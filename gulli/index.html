		<h6>Political Satire in BOOK 1: </h6> <h5>Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" is a pure piece of satire where he satirizes party politics, religious differences, and western Culture as a whole in ways still relevant to today's world. But what we find mostly after reading "Book-1" is that it is an allegorical representation of English politics. In where Swift depicts the total political corruption beginning from 16th century and ending with 18th century. </h5>
		<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<p>
One of the forms of political satire is embodied in the first culture that is met by Gulliver. In Gulliver's first adventure, he begins on a ship that runs aground on a submerged rock. He swims to land, and when he awakens, he finds himself tied down to the ground, and surrounded by tiny people, the Lilliputians. Irony is present from the start in the simultaneous recreation of Gulliver as giant and prisoner". Gulliver is surprised "at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body" (I.i.16). The Lilliputians are the embodiment of England of the time period. The Lilliputians are small people who control Gulliver through means of threats. England was a small country that had Europe (represented by Gulliver) and many other parts of the world under their control.
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
Gulliver encounters the ridiculous nature of war. His first encounter of war is in the form of a dispute over the way to eat an egg. A former king took the right of personal preference away from his people by telling them to eat the egg from the small end instead of the large end. Swift relates this trait to the situations where a dominant ruler oppresses nations. It also shows how a simple, ridiculous act can bring forth war. The fight continues through generations, soon the people continued to fight without really understanding why. Some of the people resisted, and they found refuge in Blefuscu, and "for six and thirty moons past" the two sides have been at war (I.iv.48). For Swift, Lilliput is analogous to England, and Blefuscu to France. With this event of the story Swift satirizes the needless bickering and fighting between the two nations. 
Also vehicles of Swift's satire were the peculiar customs of the nation of Lilliput. The methods of selecting people for public office in Lilliput are very different from that of any other nation, or rather, would appear to be so at first. In order to be chosen, a man must "rope dance" to the best of his abilities; the best rope dancer receives the higher office. “ this diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates for great employments and high favour at court”. While no nation of Europe in Swift's time followed such an absurd practice, they did not choose public officers on skill, but rather on how well the candidate could line the right pockets with money.
Gulliver also tells of their custom of burying "their dead with their heads directly downwards...The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still continues" (I.vi.60). At this point in the story, Gulliver has not yet realized that by seeing the absurdity of the Lilliputians' traditions, that he might see the absurdity in European ones. With this Swift satirizes the conditions of Europe. Again in the same passage, we get Flimnap. According to Swift: “Flimnap, the treasure is allowed to cut a caper on the strait rope at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole Empire" Here Swift's model for Flimnap , the most dexterous of the rope dancers, was Robert Walpole, the leader of the Whig and an extremely witty politician. His official position was like that of treasurers.
Again in the chapter 3 the kings cushions represents the Duchess of Kendal, One of George i’s mistresses, whom Walpole was believed to have bribed in order to return in power in 1721. Thus, Swift was particularly antipathetic towards the Duchess and enjoyed satirizing Walpole because during his time political corruption reached the highest peak. Again in chapter 4 , book 1, swift also narrates the folly of the religious war between Lilliput and Blefuscu to immediate European politics-“ there ( in Lilliput) have been two struggling parties in this Empire, under the name of Tramecksan and Slamecksan, from the high and low heels on their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves."
Here two Lilliputians parties stand for English political parties. The high heels represent Tories, the low heels Whigs. These two massacre the English soil both politically and by religion. In Swift's voice- "we computed the Tramecksan , or High heels , to exceed us in number; but the power wholly on our side" refers to the succession of Whigs in 1714 though the Tories were large in number. Here, it should be mentioned that at first Swift was Whig and later joined the Tory. Again the king was sympathetic to the Whigs. He used them to support Hanover against France and appointed them to official positions to strengthen his position against the House of Lords. Thus the Lilliputians empire, who is George i, wears low heels which is censured by Swift.
Therefore, we can say, religion was a political issue during Swift's time. Owing to a minor religious issue there caused a serious conflict and it also results in the division of the nation into two political groups. Many lives were taken and many kings were to lose their power even their life was taken. In the concluding part, we can say that Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels is a satirical work. Here he shows the problems , oddities……
Satire in BOOK 2:In "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift, the titular traveler learns much about the follies of mankind as he sails around the world, discovering new land. Gulliver visits four places, each interesting and strange in their own way. Swift uses each experience to satirize government, human pride, religion, philosophy, scientific conceit, human body, human talents and human limitations, pride and pretension. In the land of Brobdingnag, Gulliver encounters a race of giants, and their size and their views on government prove to be effective satirical tools.
In Brobdingnag, the status of laws is targeted by Swift. Instead of the overly complex and difficult to understand language too often used in the laws of his own land, Brobdingnagian laws are limited and plainly written, with only one possible interpretation since no law in the country can exceed in words the number of letters of their alphabet. The laws are plain and simple and easy to understand. English and American courts are well-known for being tied up in legal wrangling that cost time and money, in part due to the legalese. Without the possibility of misinterpretation, or interpretation of the law, no one will be able to corrupt the system through bribery or threats since there is only one meaning. Anyone can apply the laws in Brobdingnag without fear of being wrong unlike in the U.S. and England.
Gulliver's introduction of gun powder to the King is also satirizing European savagery. The King is morally just and humane and is surprised that European leaders would use such a weapon against enemies and their own people without a shred of remorse. Certainly we might see the King as somewhat of a fool for failing to grasp the power behind such weapons because that is Gulliver's reaction to him, but is he? Swift is purposely contrasting the King of an exotic land with the then-current King of England who would use cannons and other weapons in his own bid for more power.
If we look at the meaning of allegory, "a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one," we can get a better grasp on what Swift is trying to reveal. He's telling us that the legal system in England is unwieldy in it language that gives power over to a segment of the population to write, enforce and interpret the laws in ways that make it possible to corrupt the true purpose behind the laws. In the same way, Swift is pointing out the warmongering among European leaders is not something that a man of principles and morals would engage in at the expense of his people.
Just as Swift used the size of the Lilliputians in Gulliver's previous travels to mock their pettiness, so too does he use the size of the Brobdingnagdians to mock their pride and pretension. Swift satirizes their desire to have a large government and to assert their own importance. Though Gulliver is of smaller stature, Swift also uses this setting to satirize his own pride and, by extension, the pride of the English people. When the king asks Gulliver to tell him about the English government, Gulliver happily complies with the idea that he will impress the king with the accomplishments of his native land. However, the king concludes they are a "pernicious race of little odious vermin."
Throughout Gulliver's time on Brobdingnag, the concept of expert knowledge or authority is satirized. When Gulliver explains the way that politicians gain their position in English government and how nobleman and other important figures gain title, Swift's satiric analysis of politicians shines through. The king concludes that the only things needed to be a legislator are "ignorance, idleness, and vice." He says that it doesn't seem that any talent or proof of exceptional intelligence are required to gain any position of authority or to be considered an expert in English society.
Swift satirizes the rising belief of the time that science is all powerful, and those who believe that it can explain or control everything are foolish. He has Gulliver, who considers himself an expert sailor, shipwrecked despite his tools and knowledge. The book is also invokes concepts of magic to satirize and exaggerate the land in which it's placed. As Christopher Dow points out in "Good Science, Bad Science, and Nons(ci)ence in Gulliver's Travels," the size of the water is described to be 12 times as large as regular water, which makes it difficult for Gulliver to sail. Since water behaves consistently (and would be undrinkable it it were truly too big), Swift's exaggeration provides further satire of the natural elements in which Gulliver is placed.

Satire in BOOK 3: To remind people about the fundamental moral duties to society and fellow beings, Jonathan Swift has brought science in ‘Book- III’ of “Gulliver’s Travels”. In this book Swift satirizes the scientists science and the intellectuals. It does not mean that he was against scientific experiments. Many of Swift’s critics misunderstand when he ridicules scientist and science. He was adequately aware of the values of pure science. He has attacked science for a moral purpose. If we read, analyse and justify the third book of Gulliver’s Travels, we will be able to understand the fact.
Gulliver makes his third voyage to a flying land called Laputa which is a satire on science. It is governed by scientific rules rather than moral ones. As it is a flying land, it shows how far it is from the concrete values and reality. Thus Swift is not satirizing reason but the wrong use of reason. This is an island inhabited by men who are able to put their island into a progressive nation as they please. The Laputans’ pride in their scientific progress is quite vain since they are totally detached from common humanity, normal standard of life and reality.
The science that perverts man from his normal self and moral self is not wanted by Swift. The people of Laputa are very strange as regarding their shapes are faces. Their hands are all reclined whether to the right or the left. One of their eyes turns inward and the other directly up to the zenith. The first one signifies their engrossment in their won theories and abstract speculation. The latter shows their absorption in the stars and space. Their chief preoccupations are science, mathematics, astronomy and music. These intellectual pursuits make their outlook narrow and insensible. These pursuits engross even their practical life so much that they love their aesthetic sense. They express everything in terms of rhombus, circle and parallelograms so on. They are so unmindful and callous to the realities of life that their wives leave them to seek physical gratification. In this regard we can remember the wife of the prime minister who lives with a footman.
Next we find Gulliver in Lagado, the capital city of Balinbarbi. He finds no difference between Laputa and Lagado. The people of Lagado are also run by the system of science. Here he visits the “Academy of Projectors” where he finds a man who has been engaged in a project for eight years for extracting sun beam out of cucumbers and finds another man who has been employed for a long time to restore human excrement to its original food and other meaningless projects. But Gulliver is quite surprised that although the people are starving, the lands are left uncultivated. By mentioning the absurd experiments, Swift has created an atmosphere of useless activities, aimless researches, perverted causes and distorted reason.
Here swift is pointing out the crimes committed against humanity. The moral teaching of Swift is that intellectual pursuit is not governed by self-control and humanitarian zeal for public care. The scientist will easily forget his moral responsibility. They will think for thinking sake, not for human sake. They will work only to satisfy their vanity causing a huge loss of money, energy and time. These kinds of activities are sure to be destructive and damaging to human potentialities.
Swift is very much realistic when we see that the progress of science ushers in a moral decadence. With the advancement of science the age of Swift began to lose her ground on moral strength. Swift portrays this moral decadence with the example of the immoral life of the Laputan women.
Swift also satirized the astronomical researches of his time without becoming aware of the future success of the astronomers in exploring different stars and planets and ascending the moon. Moreover, he ridiculed those scientists who pretended to be scientists but they are actually vain, dull and non-creative.
In conclusion, it is clear that Swift’s satire on science is perfectly realistic. He feels that science deserves moral contempt for its neglect of social and moral duties. Therefore, he condemns it by witty manipulation of the scientists and their experiments which amuse us. He perfectly exposes the futility of the scientific activities which are far from reality of life.

Satire in BOOK 4: Part IV of Gulliver’s Travels contains some of the most corrosive and offensive satire on mankind. In this part the Yahoos are intended to represent human beings. The very initial description of the Yahoos given to us by Gulliver is repellent. Gulliver describes them as abominable, and he is both astonished and horrified on seeing the physical resemblance between them and persons of his own race. By contrast with the Yahoos, the Houyhnhnms are noble and benevolent animals who are governed by reason and who lead an orderly life. It is, indeed, a bitter criticism of the human race to represent the Houyhnhnms (who are horses) as being superior mentally. and morally to the Yahoos (who represent human beings). The Yahoos are brutal, unteachable, and mischievous. The Houyhnhnms, on the contrary, are morally so good that there is no word in their language for lying or falsehood.
The satire deepens when Gulliver gives to the master Houyhnhnm an account of the events and happenings in his own country and in other European countries. Gulliver tells his host that war in European countries was due sometimes to the ambition of kings and sometimes to the corruption of ministers. Gulliver speaks of the numerous deadly weapons which the European nations employ for destruction purposes. Gulliver then tells his host about the law-suits that are fought in English courts, and he speaks disparagingly about lawyers and judges. The whole of this account by Gulliver is an exposure of the evils of war and the wickedness of lawyers and judges. Gulliver also says that many people in his country ruin themselves by drinking, gambling, and debauchery; and that many are guilty of such crimes as murder, theft, robbery, forgery, rape, and sodomy.
The account which Gulliver gives of the political life in his country is really a bitter criticism of the evils that prevail not only in England but in all countries of the world. The prime minister, according to Gulliver, is a person wholly free from joy and grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; and he is a person with a violent desire for wealth, power, and titles, and with no inclination ever to tell the truth about any matter. The vast numbers of the people of his country, Gulliver says, live by begging, robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, forging, whoring, and so on. Indeed, this is not just satire but denunciation and invective.
The master Houyhnhnm tells Gulliver of the habits and the way of life of the Yahoos. He speaks of the Yahoos’ love of shining stones, their gluttony, and their weakness for liquor. The master also speaks of the lascivious behaviour of the female Yahoos. This criticism of the Yahoos is also intended as a criticism of the human race. By contrast, the Houyhnhnms are excellent beings whose grand principle is to cultivate reason and be wholly governed by it. The Houyhnhnms hold periodical meetings at which the difficulties of various sections of the population are discussed and solved. The Houyhnhnms regulate their population and do not indulge in sexual intercourse merely for pleasure. Swift’s purpose here is to attribute to horses certain qualities which would normally be expected in human beings but which are actually lacking in human beings. The main quality is reason or the rational quality which human beings, according to Swift, do not value enough.
Gulliver’s reaction to what he has seen in the land of the Houyhnhnms fills him with so much admiration for them and with so much hatred and disgust for the human race that he has no desire even to return to his family. This reaction shows that Gulliver has become a complete cynic and misanthrope, thereby further emphasizing the follies and faults from which the human race suffers and on which Swift wanted to focus our attention. Gulliver concludes his account with a severe condemnation of human pride, so that pride may be regarded as yet another target of Swift’s satire in this book.
Swift shows himself as a great satirist in this book by giving us comic satire and corrosive satire, by his successful exposure, sometimes witty and sometimes indignant, of human irrationality, by his clever use of irony, and by other devices to make us acutely conscious of the defects of mankind. If he omits the good side of mankind, it is because a satirist cannot afford to weaken the effect of his attacks by admitting the attractive features of his target or his victims. Still, it is possible to allege that Swift’s vision of mankind is too dark and pessimistic and that his counsel is the counsel of despair. Swift’s scornful and incisive satire on humanity is, indeed, a masterpiece even though it has a depressing and disheartening effect on us.

Techniques of Satire: Satire refers to a genre of literature which is often used by literary persons as a witty weapon to hold up vices, follies and shortcomings in a society to ridicule, usually with the intent of mocking individuals or society into improvement. Samuel Johnson (1709-84) defined satire as 'a poem in which wickedness or folly is censured'. Satire condemns, either overtly or covertly, what it believes to be wrong, generally with a view to achieving reform. It may be directed against an individual, a group or humanity in general. Irony, ridicule, parody, sarcasm, exaggeration are common satirical techniques, in which the first is the most common employed one. 
The author depicts every situation at great length, which makes readers feel like experiencing them personally. Although the contents of the book consist of the fantastic nature of Lemuel Gulliver’s tales, Swift inserts these stories into a contrasting framework by incorporating nautical jargon, a detailed description of Gulliver’s journey at sea in a plain and simple narrative style and thus creates an appearance of realism which makes the reader stand in dubiety in what to believe is true or not. Sometimes Gulliver’s Travels is infuriating in its insistence on detail, especially when Gulliver is in between countries and the circumstances of his movement are not very interesting in themselves. This reliable framework nevertheless is necessary as to offer the reader a trustworthy base for the satire in the story, a base which the reader easily can imagine in his real life in contrast to the exotic countries Gulliver discovers. Once Swift had laid the foundation with this credible framework, he could slip in his satirical remarks into the narration of Gulliver’s four voyages.
Swift also uses contrast as a rhetorical device to construct satirical effects. In order to reach the purpose of satire, he puts contradictory subjects together to describe and compare. There are at least three evident pairs of contrasting subjects. First is Gulliver and Lilliputians. They differ hugely in figures and in characters. The height of Gulliver's body exceeds Lilliputians' in the proportion of twelve to one. As to character differences, Gulliver is kind-hearted and grateful with a sense of justice, whereas Lilliputians are more cunning. They want to make full use of Gulliver in the war fought with its conflicting country: Blefuscu. Second, in Part II, figures of the citizens and Gulliver's again form a stark contrast. In Brobdingnag, he is put in a carriage and carried to the marketplace to perform his "tricks". He tries to please those giants by showing them his little coins and perform "tricks" with his sword. He comes into conflict with the Queen's favorite dwarf and they scheme against each other. On the other hand, the erudite King of Brobdingnag governs his country with reason, common sense, justice and mercy. The political system in Brobdingnag is very ideal and orderly, in which law guarantees freedom and welfare of the nationals. Gulliver introduces to the King England's society and political system and embellishes the truth. He describes how great England is, how judicious the politics is and how just the law is. However, he could barely defend himself facing the King's question. Besides, the comparison between the King's liberal governance and rule under England's bourgeois class reveals corruption of its politics. Third, the ruling class of the country of the Houyhnhnms are horse-like beings of reason, justice and honesty, whereas the ruled class (yahoos) are heinous, greedy and pugnacious creatures. The contrast between the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos is extreme. The horses are clean and sweet-smelling; their diet is temperate and vegetarian. Their habits constitute the temperance that the eighteenth century thought characterized reasonable man. The Yahoos, on the other hand, are human in form and feature. They are filthy and they stink. They are omnivorous but seem to prefer meat and garbage.
Irony is when the intended meaning of a statement or an action is opposite to that which is presented. A fine example of Swiftian irony is when Gulliver says he saw no mercy in the Lilliputian decision to blind him. Gulliver was actually looking for the mercy here, and, of course, there was none to be found. It is also ironic that the Brobdingnagians appear gross, but are filled with beauty. As a major technique of satire, irony involves a difference or contrast between appearance and reality - that is a discrepancy between what appears to be true and what really is true. One of the most common ways of achieving structural irony is through the use of a narrator, whose simple and straightforward comments are at variance with the reader's interpretation. Swift applies this technique in Gulliver's Travel by setting Gulliver as the narrator of the stories.

BOOK 1: When the ship Gulliver is traveling on is destroyed in a storm, Gulliver ends up on the island of Lilliput, where he awakes to find that he has been captured by Lilliputians, very small people — approximately six inches in height. Gulliver is treated with compassion and concern. In turn, he helps them solve some of their problems, especially their conflict with their enemy, Blefuscu, an island across the bay from them. Gulliver falls from favor, however, because he refuses to support the Emperor's desire to enslave the Blefuscudians and because he "makes water" to put out a palace fire. Gulliver flees to Blefuscu, where he converts a large war ship to his own use and sets sail from Blefuscu eventually to be rescued at sea by an English merchant ship and returned to his home in England.
BOOK 2: In the second book of the Travels, Swift reverses the size relationship that he used in Book I. In Lilliput, Gulliver was a giant; in Brobdingnag, Gulliver is a midget. Swift uses this difference to express a difference in morality. Gulliver was an ordinary man compared to the amoral political midgets in Lilliput. Now, Gulliver remains an ordinary man, but the Brobdingnagians are moral men. They are not perfect, but they are consistently moral. Only children and the deformed are intentionally evil.
Set against a moral background, Gulliver's "ordinariness" exposes many of its faults. Gulliver is revealed to be a very proud man and one who accepts the madness and malice of European politics, parties, and society as natural. What's more, he even lies to conceal what is despicable about them. The Brobdingnagian king, however, is not fooled by Gulliver. The English, he says, are "odious vermin." Swift praises the Brobdingnagians, but he does not intend for us to think that they are perfect humans. They are superhumans, bound to us by flesh and blood, just bigger morally than we are. Their virtues are not impossible for us to attain, but because it takes so much maturing to reach the stature of a moral giant, few humans achieve it.
Brobdingnag is a practical, moral utopia. Among the Brobdingnagians, there is goodwill and calm virtue. Their laws encourage charity. Yet they are, underneath, just men who labor under every disadvantage to which man is heir. They are physically ugly when magnified, but they are morally beautiful. We cannot reject them simply because Gulliver describes them as physically gross. If we reject them, we become even more conscious of an ordinary person's verminous morality.
BOOK 3: In Books I and II, Swift directs his satire more toward individual targets than firing broadside at abstract concepts. In Book I, he is primarily concerned with Whig politics and politicians rather than with the abstract politician; in Book II, he elects to reprove immoral Englishmen rather than abstract immorality. In Book III, Swift's target is somewhat abstract — pride in reason — but he also singles out and censures a group of his contemporaries whom he believed to be particularly depraved in their exaltation of reason. He attacks his old enemies, the Moderns, and their satellites, the Deists and rationalists. In opposition to their credos, Swift believed that people were capable of reasoning, but that they were far from being fully rational. 
This love of reason that Swift criticizes derived from the rationalism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. John Locke's theories of natural religion were popularly read, as were Descartes' theories about the use of reason. Then a loosely connected group summarized these opinions, plus others, and a cult was born: They called themselves the Deists.
In general, the Deists believed that people could reason, observe the universe accurately, and perceive axioms intuitively. With these faculties, people could then arrive at religious truth; they did not need biblical revelation. Orthodox theology has always made reason dependent on God and morality, but the Deists refuted this notion. They attacked revealed religion, saying that if reason can support the God described by the Bible, it may also conclude that God is quite different from the biblical God. The answer depends upon which observations and axioms the reasoner chooses to use.
Even before he wrote the Travels, Swift opposed excessive pride in reason. In his ironical Argument Against Abolishing Christianity, he makes plain what he considers to be the consequences of depending on reason, rather than upon faith and revelation. Disbelief, he said, is the consequence of presumptuous pride in reasoning, and immorality is the consequence of disbelief. Swift believed that religion holds moral society together. A person who does not believe in God by faith and revelation is in danger of disbelieving in morality.
To Swift, rationalism leads to Deism, Deism to atheism, and atheism to immorality. Where people worship reason, they abandon tradition and common sense. Both tradition and common sense tell humankind that murder, whoring, and drunkenness, for example, are immoral. Yet, if one depends on reason for morality, that person can find no proof that one should not drink, whore, or murder. Thus, reasonably, is one not free to do these things? Swift believed that will, rather than reason, was far too often the master.
Alexander Pope agreed with the position that Swift took. In his Essay on Man, he states that people cannot perceive accurately. Our axioms are usually contradictory, and our rational systems of living in a society are meaninglessly abstract. People, he insists, are thoroughly filled with self-love and pride; they are incapable of being rational — that is, objective. Swift would certainly concur.
In Book III, Laputan systematizing is exaggerated, but Swift's point is clear and concrete: Such systematizing is a manifestation of proud rationalism. The Laputans think so abstractly that they have lost their hold on common sense. They are so absorbed in their abstractions that they serve food in geometric and musical shapes. Everything is relegated to abstract thought, and the result is mass delusion and chaos. The Laputans do not produce anything useful; their clothes do not fit, and their houses are not constructed correctly. These people think — but only for abstract thinking's sake; they do not consider ends.
In a similar fashion, Swift shows that philology and scholarship betray the best interests of the Luggnaggians; pragmatic scientism fails in Balnibarbi; and accumulated experience does not make the Struldbruggs either happy or wise. In his topical political references, Swift demonstrates the viciousness and cruelty, as well as the folly, that arise from abstract political theory imposed by selfish politicians. The common people, Swift says, suffer. He also cites the folly of Laputan theorists and the Laputan king by referring to the immediate political blunders of the Georges.
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
BOOK 4: In Book IV, Gulliver has come to idealize the horses. They embody pure reason, but they are not human. Literally, of course, we know they are not, but figuratively they seem an ideal for humans — until Swift exposes them as dull, unfeeling creatures, thoroughly unhuman. They take no pleasure in sex, nor do they ever overflow with either joy or melancholy. They are bloodless.
The Houyhnhnms are super-reasonable. They have all the virtues that the stoics and Deists advocated. They speak clearly, they act justly, and they have simple laws. They do not quarrel or argue since each knows what is true and right. They do not suffer from the uncertainties of reasoning that afflict Man. But they are so reasonable that they have no emotions. They are untroubled by greed, politics, or lust. They act from undifferentiated benevolence. They would never prefer the welfare of one of their own children to the welfare of another Houyhnhnm simply on the basis of kinship.Very simply, the Houyhnhnms are horses; they are not humans. And this physical difference parallels the abstract difference. They are fully rational, innocent, and undepraved. Man is capable of reason, but never wholly or continuously, and he is — but never wholly or continuously — passionate, proud, and depraved. 
In contrast to the Houyhnhnms, Swift presents their precise opposite: the Yahoos, creatures who exhibit the essence of sensual human sinfulness. The Yahoos are not merely animals; they are animals who are naturally vicious. Swift describes them in deliberately filthy and disgusting terms, often using metaphors drawn from dung. The Yahoos plainly represent Mankind depraved. Swift, in fact, describes the Yahoos in such disgusting terms that early critics assumed that he hated Man to the point of madness. Swift, however, takes his descriptions from the sermons and theological tracts of his predecessors and contemporaries. If Swift hated Man, one would also have to say that St. Francis and St. Augustine did, too. Swift's descriptions of depraved Man are, if anything, milder than they might be. One sermon writer described Man as a saccusstercorum, a sack filled with dung. The descriptions of the Yahoos do not document Swift's supposed misanthropy. Rather, the creatures exhibit physically the moral flaws and natural depravity that theologians say plague the offspring of Adam.
Midway between the poles of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos, Swift places Gulliver. Gulliver is an average man, except that he has become irrational in his regard for reason. Gulliver is so disgusted with the Yahoos and so admires the Houyhnhnms that he tries to become a horse.
This aspiration to become a horse exposes Gulliver's grave weakness. Gullible and proud, he becomes such a devotee of reason that he cannot accept his fellow humans who are less than totally reasonable. He cannot recognize virtue and charity when they exist. Captain Pedro de Mendez rescues Gulliver and takes him back to Europe, but Gulliver despises him because Mendez doesn't look like a horse. Likewise, when he reaches home, Gulliver hates his family because they look and smell like Yahoos. He is still capable of seeing objects and surfaces accurately, but he is incapable of grasping true depths of meaning.
Swift discriminates between people as they are idealized, people as they are damned, people as they possibly could be, and others as they are. The Houyhnhnms embody the ideal of the rationalists and stoics; the Yahoos illustrate the damning abstraction of sinful and depraved Man; and Pedro de Mendez represents virtue possible to Man. Gulliver, usually quite sane, is misled when we leave him, but he is like most people. Even dullards, occasionally, become obsessed by something or other for a while before lapsing back into their quiet, workaday selves. Eventually, we can imagine that Gulliver will recover and be his former unexciting, gullible self.
Swift uses the technique of making abstractions concrete to show us that super-reasonable horses are impossible and useless models for humans. They have never fallen and therefore have never been redeemed. They are incapable of the Christian virtues that unite passion and reason: Neither they nor the Yahoos are touched by grace or charity. In contrast, the Christian virtues of Pedro de Mendez and the Brobdingnagians (the "least corrupted" of mankind) are possible to humans. These virtues are the result of grace and redemption. Swift does not press this theological point, however. He is, after all, writing a satire, not a religious tract.
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
Yahoo and Houyhnhnms: In the fourth voyage, Swift presents a case study for opposing states of nature, with the Yahoos representing the argument that man is governed by his passions, seeking his own advantage, pursuing pleasures and avoiding pain, and the Houyhnhnms representing the argument that man is governed by reason. Yahoos are the human-like creatures that Gulliver first encounters in the Country of the Houyhnhnms. Though to an outside observer, they are by all rights very much human-looking, they do indeed behave as animals. They are filthy and matted with dirt, they stink, and while they are capable of an omnivorous diet, they seem to prefer meat and garbage. Specifically, they are noted to consume nearly everything that is prohibited by the biblical and Levitical food codes. Of the Yahoo, Gulliver states they are: "the most filthy, noisome, and deformed animals which nature ever produced . . . " and they are "restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious." The Yahoos are not simply feral and animalistic, they are man-animals who are naturally vicious and represent the crudest and most corrupt of mankind's primal nature. Swift describes them in deliberately offensive and off-putting terms, frequently drawing them into metaphors with dung. On the evolutionary scale, the words Swift uses to describe the Yahoos are "degenerating by degrees."
Gulliver is painted as being midway between the two opposite ends of this spectrum, both figuratively and literally. He shares some similarities with both races, in some ways like the hyper-rational, and innocent Houyhnhnms, and in other ways like the filthy, emotion-driven Yahoos. At first, Gulliver refuses to admit having anything at all in common with the Yahoos, or vice-versa. He is shown to detest them, and is horrified upon further examination by the Yahoos' similarity to him. Yet he still lacks the humility to see himself as any sort of Yahoo, instead his pride leads him to the absurdity of trying to become a horse. Gulliver will endeavor with admirable determination to improve upon himself; he will strive to change himself into a more horse-like state, but he will obviously fail. To his dismay, he is quite clearly more of a Yahoo than a Houyhnhnm.
Gulliver's description of the horses, the Houyhnhnms, is almost idyllic: "The behaviour of these animals was . . . orderly and rational . . . acute and judicious." Indeed, it is a horse that rescues him from the Yahoos — not by any overt, physical action, but by simply appearing on the road — no physical action being necessary. Houyhnhnms live simple lives wholly devoted to reason. They speak clearly, they act justly, and they have simple laws. Each Houyhnhnm knows what is right and acts accordingly. They are untroubled by greed, politics, or lust. They live a life of cleanliness and exist in peace and serenity. They live by the grand maxim: Cultivate Reason and be totally governed by it. So perfect is their society, in fact, that they have no concept of a lie, and therefore no word to express it. The only word for evil is "Yahoo."
Swift defines Houyhnhnm as meaning "perfection of nature." This definition establishes an important distinction. The horses are uncorrupted by passion — either base or noble. They are devoid, for example, of charity. Also, they are not subject to temptation. Swift, however, never suggests that the Houyhnhnms stand for perfected human nature; on the contrary, they manifest innocent human nature. What they do — and what they say and think — is akin to human nature, but the character of the Houyhnhnms is far from Gulliver's. They are ignorant of many things which most people would consider venial. They cannot, for example, understand lying — or even the necessity for lying. Swift thus establishes a range, or spectrum, of existence. The horses are literally innocent, having never "fallen"; the Yahoos are super-sensual and seem depraved. The Houyhnhnms are ice-cold reason; the Yahoos are fiery sensuality. In between these extremes is Gulliver.
The moral of the encounter with the Yahoos and the Houyhnhnms is that Reason alone might be enough for men if they would only use it properly. Yet instead of employing it as the Houyhnhnms did to eliminate passion, in the words of Gulliver’s host, "We made no other use of it than by its assistance to aggravate our natural corruptions, and to acquire new ones which Nature had not given us” (Swift page #). Reason, instead of leading men into virtue, led them into vice. To the Houyhnhnms, therefore, they were not better than the Yahoos, they were worse: the Yahoos at least had the excuse that they were not endowed with Reason. Gulliver came to this same conclusion. 
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
Gulliver as Misanthropist: Paul Turner writes of Gulliver’s four voyages: “The four pictures form a series, in which the view grows gradually darker; that is, they represent stages in Gulliver's disillusionment.” In the first part of the book, Swift takes us to the land of midgets, the “human creatures not more than six inches high”. Lilliput is a miniature empire with a little monarch who entitled himself as "delight and terror of the universe". In Lilliput, which is, quite literally, a microcosm, the vices and follies not merely of England but of all mankind are epitomized. The human race viewed in miniature, at first seems rather charming; but the tiny creatures soon turn out to be cunning, malicious, treacherous and revengeful. They are ready to sacrifice all humane feeling, whether towards Gulliver or the Blefuscudians, to their own petty ambitions.
In book 2, in Brobdingnag, however, it is as if we are looking at humanity through a magnifying glass. Gulliver is often repulsed by both the size and coarseness of the physical bodies of the Brobdingnagians. But Swift throws in a nice twist with the first two parts of Gulliver's Travels. Though the Brobdingnagians are more repulsive physically because of their size, they are categorized by Gulliver as "the least corrupted". When Gulliver gives brief description of the political and legal institutions of England to Brobdingnagian King, the King dismissively concludes "the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth." 
Swift was certainly not one of the optimists typical of his century. He did not believe that the ‘Age of Science’ was a triumph. Science and reason needed limits, and they did not require absolute devotion. In order to satirize mankind in general and science in particular, Swift takes us to an imaginary floating island where the inhabitants were wholly engrossed in their fruitless meditation. "Their heads were all reclined either to the right, or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith.” The various researches that were in progress at the Academy of Projectors in Lagado were fantastic and preposterous. Experiments were being made “to extract sunbeams out of cucumbers, to convert human excrement into its original food, to build houses from the roof downwards to the foundation, to obtain silk from cobwebs”
Swift’s alleged misanthropy reaches its crescendo in the fourth voyage of Gulliver.As Gulliver reaches the land governed by philosophical horses Houyhnhnms, he is instantly confronted with a pack of Yahoos which give him such an obnoxious and disgusting treatment that he develops an intense hatred for them, owing to their vile physical appearance and their filthy and mischievous way of life. Gulliver highlights: “Upon the whole, I never behold in all my travels so disagreeable an animal, nor one against which I naturally conceived so strong an antipathy.” The Houyhnhnms, on the other hand, are “endued with a proportionable degree of reason” and “orderly and rational, acute and judicious”. They know neither love nor grief nor lust nor ambition for they face each of these phenomena with stoical calm. Their cardinal virtues are “friendship and benevolence”. The Houyhnhnms are “the Perfection of Nature” while “the Yahoos … were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes”. Gulliver’s epiphany occurs he identifies himself with the detestable Yahoos: “My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I observed in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure.”
The theme of Gulliver’s hatred of mankind is climaxed when he told he must leave Houyhnhnmland. He exclaims “that the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils, for…how could I think with temper of passing my days among Yahoos”. Thus Gulliver would rather die than live among his own race of Yahoos. Nonetheless, he must leave. But he plans not to go home, but to find some small uninhabited island so that he can, in solitude, “reflect with delight on the virtues of those imitable Houyhnhnms.” Yet, fate would not allow it. He is discovered by Portuguese Captain and seamen and is forcibly rescued and given passage to Lisbon. With the short-sightedness of the Houyhnhnms, Gulliver perceives only the Yahoo and is repelled by Captain Don Pedro de Mendez’s clothes, food, and odour as he remarks: “I wondered to find such civilities from a Yahoo. However, I remained silent and sullen; I was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.”Gulliver’s frenzy of his extreme misanthropy has driven him into madness as can no longer bear his own wife and children: “I began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the farthest end of a long table…. Yet the smell of a Yahoo continuing very offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue, lavender, or tobacco leaves. “
While the character of Gulliver eventually reveals himself to be a misanthrope, the author Jonathan Swift does not. The reader must be conscientious to see that Gulliver’s idealized glance of Houyhnhnms’ logical approach to life is not always consistent with Swift’s. A carful denotation suggests that the author is just as satirical toward Gulliver and the Houyhnhnms as he is toward the Yahoos. Gulliver remains true to his gullible nature as he seems unable to discern the negative aspects of the Houyhnhnms’ rational philosophy. Swift, on other hand, uses these quadrupeds to show how reason untouched by love, compassion, and empathy is also inadequate to deal with the myriad aspects of the human life.
****Jonathan Swift is undoubtedly is a great artist but he had to face unreasonable and prejudiced criticism in the hands of his contemporaries, because he had unveiled the brutality of man which was hidden under the mask of humanism. Swift’s age was full of vices of corruption but still the people were satisfied. Swift gives us a true picture of the man of that age in “Gulliver’s Travels”. In the last voyage, his satire becomes very bitter when he presents horses more reasonable than man. Swift is notorious for being misanthropist in the last part of the “Gulliver’s Travels”.
Swift has to face the allegation of being misanthropist for during whole of his life. It is because the critics attributed Gulliver’s blunders to Swift. But, he makes his aim in “Gulliver’s Travels” clear in his letter to Alexander Pope. He says, “The chief end of all my labour is to vex the world, rather than divert it”. Secondly, he declares that “He has ever hated all the nations, professions and communities and all his love for individuals.” He hates men but loves man. He hates the animal like vices in man; the crown of creation. He was shocked to see the follies of men of his age and didn’t consider this reasonable. This means he does not hate mankind but considers them unreasonable and wants to reform them by his condemnation. Gulliver's Travels is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticized for its apparent misanthropy. “Gulliver’s Travels” gives a definite message to us. Swift advises us to keep a balance between rationality and sensuality. As if we choose anyone of them, we will be either a Yahoo or a Houyhnhnm and not a man. 
Gulliver, in the last voyage, became a misanthropist is undeniable and indisputable. In the fourth voyage, Gulliver reaches a country of animals, ruled by animals. There were two categories of animals living there in; ugly and repulsive brutes Yahoos and intelligent and rational Houyhnhnms. The former appears to him nasty and obnoxious, so the feelings of disliking develop in his heart for them. On the other hand, his meeting with Houyhnhnms proves a nice experience. They secure him against Yahoos, treated him kindly and took him to their state. Naturally, this kind of behavior created a sort of fondness in Gulliver’s heart for them and their way of life. Up to that time nothing was objectionable, but his fault began, when he is so bewitched of Houyhnhnms that he also started hating men. As Houyhnhnms hate Yahoos and Gulliver equating Yahoos with men also began hating men. He developed a general hatred against all men. All the subsequent incidents, his hatred against the captain and his family, etc. reflect his misanthropy.
The blunder committed by Gulliver is that he over idealized Houyhnhnms. Actually, he was fed up of man’s corruption and could not bear it. He found Yahoos slave of emotions, sensuality and sentimentality. But, he found Houyhnhnms in comparatively better condition than Yahoos. They lack all types of corruption that yahoos had. In fact, the Houyhnhnms lack any kind of emotions and have pure intellect that’s why he also started thinking that remedy of all the vices of man is to get rid of his emotions. In the result, when he was forced to return to his native country, it was natural for him to hate his fellowmen. But, finding no other way, he slowly reconciled himself to this world.
So, if Gulliver during the course of the book changes and grows mad, it doesn’t mean that creator too changes with his creation and grows mad. In fact, part 4 has been completely misunderstood. Misidentifying Gulliver with Swift, we think as if Swift in the form of Gulliver had started hating Yahoos. In fact, part 4 has complex meaning and is full of irony. However, it is a fact that Gulliver became misanthropist, not Swift.
