				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>For all of Bitcoin’s fabled transparency, a key piece of this bubblicious puzzle remains elusively opaque. Who the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto?</h3>
<p>Like a frustrating episode of Lost, there’s one too many clues and few if any answers. Satoshi, of course, is the one who started it all, unleashing his concept of a cryptographic, self-regulating digital currency to the world in his now infamous whitepaper in 2008.</p>
<p>Three years later, he was gone.</p>
<p>Today, Bitcoin is a billion dollar idea being adopted across the globe, and yet little is known about its enigmatic creator. The result has been wild speculation. Ted Nelson, the American pioneer of information technology who coined the term “hypertext,” <a href="http://qz.com/86255/the-mysterious-creator-of-bitcoin-could-be-japanese-mathematician-shinichi-mochizuki-says-the-inventor-of-hypertext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week proposed</a> that Satoshi was a well-known, reclusive Japanese mathematician. <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Yorker</a></em> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em></a> have conducted their own investigations. Various theories <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulate on the web</a>.</p>
<p>Given Satoshi’s paranoid preservation of his privacy, there are no conclusions, only educated guesses. But who doesn’t love a good conspiracy theory, especially when the topic is a disruptive technology that many believe has the potential to truly shakregistere things up?</p>
<h3>WHAT WE KNOW</h3>
<p>Satoshi appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 2008 when he <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a research paper</a> on the <a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptography Mailing List</a>, which laid the foundation for the Bitcoin protocol. He claimed to have been working on the idea for about two years, which, given the robustness of what was produced, implied an exhaustive amount of effort dedicated toward his work.</p>
<p>In January of 2009, he started mining, creating what is known as the “<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genesis block</a>.” Bitcoin v0.1 was released six days later. By year-end, over 32,000 blocks had been added to this original block, producing a total of 1,624,250 bitcoins. Since all transactions are public on the blockchain, we know that only a quarter of those bitcoins have ever changed hands, leading some to speculate that Satoshi could be sitting on a stash of roughly one million bitcoins, worth ~$120 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the early days, Satoshi was active on the Bitcoin Forum and regularly responded to emails. Though Bitcoin is an open source project, most modifications to the source code were made by Satoshi himself in the first year, but his activity soon began to peter out.</p>
<p>His final programming contribution was made in mid-2010, after he had passed on the reins to Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s current lead developer. In April of 2011, when asked of his dwindling activity, Satoshi explained to one Bitcoin developer that he had “moved on to other things.” At some point, he stopped replying to emails altogether, including those of Andresen. The creator had disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161" style="max-width: 526px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-161" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg" alt="An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto" width="526" height="419" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto</figcaption></figure>
<p>The name Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be a pseudonym for a person, a group, or even a larger, possibly governmental organization. In Japanese, Satoshi means “clear-thinking” or “wise.” Naka can mean “inside” or “relationship” and moto is used to describe “the origin” or “the foundation.” Put it all together and you get “thinking clearly inside the foundation.” There’s scant evidence that Nakamoto existed outside the context of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>According to his P2P foundation account details, Satoshi claimed to be a 37-year-old male living in Japan. His language of choice was English, but he would alternate between British and American spellings and colloquialisms, which could mean that he was trying to mask his nationality or that Satoshi is actually more than one person. He would post on the forums and respond to emails at random times with no discernible patterns that might indicate a primary time zone.</p>
<p>Based on his limited body of work, we know that Satoshi is highly intelligent and economically competent. He’s a brilliant mathematician, well-versed in cryptography, and a capable programmer, though his code indicates that he most likely wasn’t a professional.</p>
<p>While theoretically sound, his style belied his experience (or lack thereof), leading some, including Andresen, to believe that Satoshi is an academic. A prominent fear in the early days was that some exploitable flaw in the Bitcoin system would eventually surface, undermining the movement. Four years later, the protocol remains bulletproof, a testament to Satoshi’s genius, foresight, and thoroughness. It also suggests that, if he really is a single entity, Satoshi is a hell of a proofreader.</p>
<p>Though it appeared that Satoshi understood that the Bitcoin movement might attract its fair share of ideologues, such as anti-government libertarians, it’s unclear whether or not Satoshi was politically motivated himself. If at times he seemed eager to recruit such groups to the cause, his intent could be interpreted as pragmatic. Keenly aware of the potential social implications of his idea, he left the politicizing to others.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” he wrote. “I&#8217;m better with code than with words though.” We know, based on his writings, that he had qualms with the banking system and saw Bitcoin as a technological solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#8217;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.</p>
<p>A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. Its time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>THE PRIME SUSPECTS</h3>
<p>Analysis of Satoshi’s coding and writing style have been inconclusive. But with the facts available, a few prominent suspects have emerged, some more widely accepted than others.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Andresen</strong>: As the Bitcoin project’s lead developer, he is an obvious choice (though perhaps too obvious by Satoshi’s standards). Andresen serves as chief scientist on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and equivalent of the Linux’s Linus Torvalds. Outside of Satoshi, Andresen has the most influence on Bitcoin’s direction. The mild-mannered programmer’s technical savvy and work ethic is universally admired within the community.</p>
<p>He has sometimes been referred to as Bitcoin’s “Batman” for his altruism and the nature of his often unrewarding role. One Bitcoin developer who has frequently corresponded with Andresen but wished to remain anonymous, claims conversational similarities between the two, though this has been disputed. Could Satoshi be hiding in plain sight?</p>
<p>Andresen denied being Satoshi when we broached the question over the weekend at the 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose, saying he has a different coding style than Satoshi does.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Clear, Donal O’Mahony, Hitesh Tewari and Michael Peirce of Trinity College, Dublin</strong>: An investigation by Joshua Davis of the New Yorker ultimately led to Michael Clear, a then 23-year-old graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College. Despite his age, Clear appeared to check enough boxes to fit the bill. Named Trinity’s top computer science student in 2008, Clear had co-authored a paper on peer-to-peer cryptography. He was also British. Davis tracked Clear down at the Crytpo 2011 conference in Santa Barbara where Clear denied the allegations. “I&#8217;m not Satoshi,” he said. “But even if I was I wouldn&#8217;t tell you.” (That refrain is common in the Satoshi search.)</p>
<p>Davis’s report prompted further digging among the community, which led to Donal O’Mahony, a professor at the university; Hitesh Tewari, a research assistant; and Michael Peirce, a student, because of various published materials connecting the four including this paper and this book. Along with Clear, the group has been called the Crypto Mano Group (mano is Irish for coin) or CMG. Perhaps coincidentally, none have publicly discussed Bitcoin in spite of their relevant body of work.</p>
<p><strong>Neal J. King, Charles Bry, and Vladamir Oksman</strong>: The New Yorker piece prompted Adam L. Penenberg of Fast Company to conduct his own search for Bitcoin’s mysterious creator. A textual analysis of Satoshi’s whitepaper led Penenberg to a patent application, which shared the term &#8220;computationally impractical to reverse.&#8221; To Penenberg’s surprise, the patent had been filed just three days before the domain Bitcoin.org was registered.</p>
<p>All three have filed patent applications that have to do with encryption, communication, networks, and nodes. All three have also denied being Satoshi, with King going as far as shooting down the concept. “It’s not a very good idea,” King told Penenberg. “Nakamoto’s algorithm is a solution in search of a problem.”</p>
<p>King has been consistent with his skepticism. His latest comment at the Economist continues his argument as to why Bitcoin won’t work: “It never makes contact with the physical world, except through the concepts of credulous dreamers that have not quite woken up.” Knowing Satoshi, however, it could be a ploy to cover his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong>: McCaleb’s name is often brought up during discussions of Satoshi’s identity. The UC Berkeley dropout co-founded Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo—a questionable decision given Japan’s high corporate tax rate and regulatory red tape. This has led some to cite this as evidence of a tenuous affinity for the country without McCaleb actually being Japanese. McCaleb also founded eDonkey in 2000, one of the largest (and technically revered) peer-to-peer file-sharing networks at the time.</p>
<p>He would later sell the highly profitable Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, saying that while the service was “cool and needed to exist,” it was no longer “technically interesting.” Once an enthusiastic Bitcoin supporter, McCaleb had also become disillusioned by the protocol’s system of mining “because it wastes so much energy.” He would go on to develop Ripple, what he believes to be an improved iteration of the Bitcoin concept that addresses some of these flaws. Could this have been what Satoshi meant when he said he had “moved on”?</p>
<p><strong>Shinichi Mochizuki</strong>: A recent feature on the Japanese mathematician has prompted Nelson, among others, to speculate that the eccentric genius had, while solving the famed ABC Conjecture, one of math world’s most complex problems, created Bitcoin in his spare time. It’s tough to question Mochizuki’s abilities and the patterns seem to fit.</p>
<p>Like Satoshi, Mochizuki released his ABC Conjecture proof on the internet (instead of established academic channels) and simply walked away, refusing to explain his potentially historic work to the great frustration of mathematicians everywhere. Mochizuki is also a native English speaker, though it’s unclear if he can code or is knowledgeable in cryptography. But given Mochizuki’s mathematics acumen and incredible smarts, it’s not impossible to believe he taught himself along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong>: A conspiracy theorist’s wet dream, another idea that gets tossed around is that Bitcoin is the product of some government or governmental agency. From that vantage point, resources are no longer an issue. But why? The answer is more of an intellectual exercise than actual theory.</p>
<p>Bitcoin could be used as a weapon against the US dollar. It could be used to fund black ops, sort of like a currency version of onion routing, which was first developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. It could be used to strategically trim the overweight financial sector.</p>
<p>If governments believed a widely used digital currency was inevitable, Bitcoin could be a preemptive strike against a potentially malevolent iteration. From the US perspective, it could have been created as a hedge against the waning international power of the dollar, though given the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, this seems unlikely. The same could be said about the EU and the flailing euro. Along these lines, some have pointed to EU directives on digital currencies that were implemented and voted for well before Bitcoin became widely known as a possible clue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scariest theory of all is that Bitcoin is actually an Orwellian vehicle that would allow governments to monitor all financial transactions. Bitcoin is often touted for its anonymity, but the transparent nature of the blockchain means every transaction is potentially traceable. Even if each transaction is only associated with a key, armed with enough information, certain organizations would eventually be able to connect the dots. In theory, anyway. In reality, government involvement isn&#8217;t likely, though by no means an impossibility.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE DON’T KNOW</h3>
<p>In the end, we’re right back where we started: a few theories, some circumstantial evidence, and nothing remotely conclusive. It takes only brief examination of his essentially perfect execution of the Bitcoin protocol to realize that Satoshi Nakamoto would treat his quest for privacy with the same level of comprehension. He is a master of the long game.</p>
<p>And no wonder. The creators of e-gold were charged with &#8220;conspiracy to engage in money laundering&#8221; and the &#8220;operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business&#8221; in July of 2008, just months before Satoshi unveiled Bitcoin. Given the treatment of guys like Julian Assange and Kim Dotcom, there’s little upside to being an internet hero when your platform has the potential to disrupt governments and big business.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the possibility that Satoshi could make a comeback at some point. Some within the community assume he is keeping an eye on things, but could re-emerge, if necessary, to right the ship.</p>
<p>“He could kind of step in and say, ‘This is bad.’ It could happen,” a Bitcoin developer told me. “And he would absolutely have enough sway. His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.”</p>
<p>Satoshi could then verify it was him by signing a message to one of his keys from his genesis block. Until then, it’s clear he’s quite content keeping his identity a secret.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Imagine the street you live on is knee-deep in floodwater, and it’s ruining everything in sight, including your home. Now imagine that those awful floodwaters never, ever recede. Instead, the water just keeps rising and rising until your entire country drowns.</h3>
<p>For a number of island nations, that&#8217;s ultimately the significance of the recent reports about <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the unstoppable melt of the massive ice sheets of Antarctica</a> and Greenland, along with hundreds of glaciers.</p>
<p>“We’ve already lost some island atolls. On others the rising sea is destroying homes, washing away coffins and skeletons from graves,” Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, told me. “Now with every full moon the high tides brings salt water into our streets. We’re moving further inland but can’t move much further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Marshall Islands are located in the northern Pacific Ocean, and are home to some 70,000 people spread out over 24 low-lying coral atolls. Low-lying, as in six feet above sea level on average. Not only do rising seas flood and erode shorelines, they also make groundwater too salty too drink and “poison” the land with salt so crops and even coconuts trees can’t grow.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Motherboard reported</a> that the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet was underway, guaranteeing a minimum of three metres (10 feet) of sea level rise. Another <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/19/doubling-of-antarctic-ice-loss-revealed-by-european-satellite?utm_source=Daily+Carbon+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=d8e2a29f35-DAILY_BRIEFING&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_876aab4fd7-d8e2a29f35-303421281" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> said the melting ice is 31 per cent faster now than between 2005 and 2011. Way up in Greenland, the same thing is happening, according to a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience. And then there was the recent US National Climate Assessment that found Alaska’s and Canada’s glaciers are pumping huge volumes of water into the ocean.</p>
<p>Add it all up and this means many small island nations like the Marshalls—along with countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu, Micronesia, Kiribati, Palau and others—will be swallowed by the sea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_177" style="max-width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401200280336425.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-177" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401200280336425.png" alt="Tony de Brum (left) at UN climate COP 19 in Warsaw with US chief negotiator Todd Stern.

<p>“Where are we to go? How are we to survive? What happens to our culture? Will we become wards of another state?” asked de Brum.</p>
<p>“The news from Antarctica should be sobering to anyone from a coastal region around the world,” said Ambassador Marlene Moses of the Republic of Nauru, a small island in the South Pacific home to fewer than 10,000 people.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“We will be moving villages for decades to come. It’s almost beyond comprehension.”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Moses is also chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a coalition of 43 low-lying island and coastal nations who are fighting hard to get countries like the US, Canada, China, Japan, and Australia to slash their CO2 emissions and keep future global warming below 1.5 C˚. Anything higher, they believe, and most of these nations will drown.</p>
<p>“I can tell you personally it has been very upsetting to witness what seems like an indifference to the plight of small islands,” Moses said.</p>
<p>When told of the recent science out of Antarctica and Greenland, Claire Anterea, a community worker from the central Pacific island nation of Kiribati responded in despair, “My gosh this is not fair! If the world can’t stop the glacier collapse who will save my people and my country?”</p>
<p>“We have a beautiful life here,” she said, “a simple and subsistence way of living. It is unexplainable to know that our beloved home will disappear.” Kiribati consists of 30-odd pancake flat coral atolls straddling the equator.</p>
<p>The government of Kiribati is hoping to buy thousands of acres on one of Fiji’s islands to relocate its 115,000 residents. While relocation may mean survival, the literal disappearance of their islands risks the overwhelming loss of their culture and identity. When you live on tiny islands in the middle of the enormous Pacific Ocean, land has a very special meaning.</p>
<p>“Without our land how can I explain to my children their roots? Where they come from in the first place?” she said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_179" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/140120041171591.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-179" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/140120041171591-2000x1539.jpg" alt="Marlene Moses at the Bangkok Climate Change Conference in August 2012.

<p>Although most of Fiji’s 322 islands won’t vanish under the rising waves—at least not in the next century or so—many of the coastal villages are at risk. One is already being re-located to higher ground. Adapt and retreat is Fiji’s future, and that of its 850,000 people.</p>
<p>“We will be moving villages for decades to come. It’s almost beyond comprehension,” said Alifereti Tawake, a Fijian with the Locally-Managed Marine Area Network.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of all villages are on the coast, he said in an interview from the capital city of Suva. Tawake’s home village of Daku on Kadavu, a small outer island is being flooded during high tides and the people will have to move one day.</p>
<p>People have a very strong attachment to their home village. Everything in the village has important family, cultural and spiritual significance. It is the roots of people’s identity, Tawake said.</p>
<p>Villages that have been proudly self-sufficient for hundreds of years are suddenly helpless and now have to ask for help from outsiders.</p>
<p>“People are saying ‘even if we do everything right, we can’t do anything to stop this,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned. We are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The small island of Hatohobei and Helen Reef Atoll in Palau is already eroding away. “Soon we will be forced to leave our homes,” said Wayne Andrew from Palau, a country of around 22,000 people, who are spread across 250 islands in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>“To be very honest, I feel really scared,” said Andrews, who heads a reef protection organization in Palau. Local people wonder what they’ve done wrong and “why they have to pay the ultimate price when other nations are benefiting from all this,” he said, referring to wealthy nations’ high CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Painful discussions are underway about relocation and moving traditional taro patches and gardens to higher places. There is a lot of work being undertaken to find ways to adapt to the impacts climate change, he said. But ultimately “it is very difficult to know much of our country will vanish.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_180" style="max-width: 1598px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Malé_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-180" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Malé_after_tsunami_cropped.jpg" alt="Malé, the capital of the Maldives, after the 2004 tsunami.

<p>Painful is one way to describe the 20 years of United Nations climate negotiations that might have kept the island nations from drowning. This is all about countries agreeing to make major reductions in their CO2 emissions that are heating up the planet. A climate-saving treaty is supposed be finalized at the end of 2015. To say negotiations are not going well is an understatement.</p>
<p>“There is no sense of urgency. It’s frustrating,” said Foreign Minister de Brum, who had just returned home to the Marshall Islands from an informal round of UN climate talks. Countries with the biggest CO2 emissions are more concerned about their economies than the survival of small island nations de Brun said.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time the rest of the world awakes to crisis we&#8217;ve drowned,” he said. “We are like cockroaches trying to herd elephants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of cockroaches, the three-coral atoll nation of Tokelau became the first country in the world to become 100 percent powered by renewable energy last October. The 1400 Tokelauans are technically living in a territory of New Zealand. In March this year, Tokelau activists along with 15 other Pacific nations held a series of protests against the fossil fuel industry proclaiming: “We are not drowning. We are fighting.”</p>
<p>“Giving up on our home is not an option,” said Tokelau’s Mikaele Maiava, an activist with 350.org.</p>
<p>“We are warriors, and the land we live on is part of us.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine trying to throw a dart at a bullseye that’s 200 feet away with only your bare hands. Now, add a blindfold to the equation. Theoretically, it might be possible. But practically, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible—about the same odds as trying to break a new form of software protection called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation—similar in nature to a technology IBM has patented called homomorphic encryption—is one of the possible futures of cryptography. The main idea behind it is relatively straightforward: through some arcane math, a team of six cryptography experts have figured out that it’s possible to mask code, making it nearly impenetrable to hacks, while at the same time still being possible to run as useful software.</p>
<p>“Traditional encryption is about securing data,” said Dr. Dan Boneh, an encryption expert at Stanford. “Obfuscation is about securing software—a very different notion than encryption.”</p>
<p>The obfuscator works like this. A developer would code a piece of software, and then for added security, run it through a typical garbler, as most commercial software is these days. Following that, the developer would run the garbled software through the indistinguishability obfuscator—think of it kind of like an encryption application.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The obfuscator takes a part the garbled code and mixes random elements together in such a way that when the obfuscated program is run in its intended fashion, the randomness is negated, and the intended output is generated. If the program is told to do something other than what its designer intended, it won’t work.</p>
<p>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it,” Boneh said.</p>
<p>Today most closed source code is obfuscated to some degree—not directly accessible to prying eyes. But, such code is nearly always hackable given enough resources, cryptography expert Dr. Zachary Peterson told me over the phone. And online, most code is openly embedded in web pages, and can be easily studied. That’s why being able to use indistinguishability obfuscation to create “black box” software is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dr. Amit Sahai—one of the researchers who made the breakthrough, and who has been working on the obfuscation for 17 years—took pains to explain that despite catchy headlines, the claim obfuscation would make software “unhackable” isn’t accurate. The reality is that it still would be possible to crack—just that with current technology it would be damn hard.</p>
<p>“You might get lucky and hit the dart board, it’s just a hell of a lot harder,&#8221; he said. (The dart board thing was my metaphor, but Sahai said it was a good one so we sort of talked around it.)</p>
<p>It’s important to note that right now this new form of software obfuscation is completely impractical to use, Sahai said. It would take weeks, or months to receive a meaningful result from querying an obfuscated program. That’s mostly because of computing power, and the incredibly complex calculations necessary to run obfuscated code.​</p>
<p>“We have the first mathematical approach,” he said, “This isn’t coming in the next couple of years to say the least.”</p>

<p>Still, having the ability to develop black box software would allow tight controls on what it’s used for, and potentially could ensure a greater amount of privacy for people using cloud services such as Gmail. For example, if the email service’s ad-serving software package were obfuscated, it would be impossible for either Google or third parties to do anything other than check email keywords and select which ads were served, Sahai explained.</p>
<p>(Of course, for that particular example to succeed, Sahai said you’d have to be willing to trust that Google programmed the black box to do what they claimed it did.)</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation could be used to plant controls on digital and real-world surveillance technologies. For example, if you’re worried that red light cameras can also double as license plate readers—a controversial technology that the ACLU says may infringe on Americans’ liberties—obfuscated software scanning the images could ensure they would be used only for their apparent purpose—doling out red light tickets.</p>
<p>Another example of its use, also having to do with government accountability, is this: Were the NSA to build an obfuscated black box into a surveillance software packages such as XKeyscore, it could theoretically force agents to use XKeyscore for specific purposes—whether that means preventing XKeyscore searches on American citizens, or whatever other predefined limitations deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Also, inevitably, obfuscation would end up making into the future generations of malicious programs such as malware, remote access trojans, and other hacker tools. While it wouldn’t make malware any tougher to capture, once a researcher does end up getting their hands on it, they will have a much harder time cracking the black box open, Sahai said, and therefore may make it harder to build defenses against.</p>
<p>Those are only a few possibilities of the uses for obfuscation that I discussed with the security researchers I interviewed for this report. There are numerous others including email encryption (by handing over a black box to a friend that can decrypt messages), shorter and more efficient digital signatures—used to sign software patches, for example, which sounds simple but is actually tough and important—as well as solve dozens of what cryptographers call open problems.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges ahead, Sahai pointed out that when RSA’s first encryption schemes came out in the 1970s they were totally impractical as well. Today, they’re seamlessly integrated into machines. Peterson said that while the concept still needs to be proven, the potential is intriguing.</p>
<p>“It’s worth approaching with a healthy sense of skepticism,” Peterson said. “But as far as I can tell cryptographers are excited about its possibilities.”</p>
