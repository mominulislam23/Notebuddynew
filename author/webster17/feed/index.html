				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>For all of Bitcoin’s fabled transparency, a key piece of this bubblicious puzzle remains elusively opaque. Who the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto?</h3>
<p>Like a frustrating episode of Lost, there’s one too many clues and few if any answers. Satoshi, of course, is the one who started it all, unleashing his concept of a cryptographic, self-regulating digital currency to the world in his now infamous whitepaper in 2008.</p>
<p>Three years later, he was gone.</p>
<p>Today, Bitcoin is a billion dollar idea being adopted across the globe, and yet little is known about its enigmatic creator. The result has been wild speculation. Ted Nelson, the American pioneer of information technology who coined the term “hypertext,” <a href="http://qz.com/86255/the-mysterious-creator-of-bitcoin-could-be-japanese-mathematician-shinichi-mochizuki-says-the-inventor-of-hypertext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week proposed</a> that Satoshi was a well-known, reclusive Japanese mathematician. <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Yorker</a></em> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em></a> have conducted their own investigations. Various theories <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulate on the web</a>.</p>
<p>Given Satoshi’s paranoid preservation of his privacy, there are no conclusions, only educated guesses. But who doesn’t love a good conspiracy theory, especially when the topic is a disruptive technology that many believe has the potential to truly shakregistere things up?</p>
<h3>WHAT WE KNOW</h3>
<p>Satoshi appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 2008 when he <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a research paper</a> on the <a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptography Mailing List</a>, which laid the foundation for the Bitcoin protocol. He claimed to have been working on the idea for about two years, which, given the robustness of what was produced, implied an exhaustive amount of effort dedicated toward his work.</p>
<p>In January of 2009, he started mining, creating what is known as the “<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genesis block</a>.” Bitcoin v0.1 was released six days later. By year-end, over 32,000 blocks had been added to this original block, producing a total of 1,624,250 bitcoins. Since all transactions are public on the blockchain, we know that only a quarter of those bitcoins have ever changed hands, leading some to speculate that Satoshi could be sitting on a stash of roughly one million bitcoins, worth ~$120 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the early days, Satoshi was active on the Bitcoin Forum and regularly responded to emails. Though Bitcoin is an open source project, most modifications to the source code were made by Satoshi himself in the first year, but his activity soon began to peter out.</p>
<p>His final programming contribution was made in mid-2010, after he had passed on the reins to Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s current lead developer. In April of 2011, when asked of his dwindling activity, Satoshi explained to one Bitcoin developer that he had “moved on to other things.” At some point, he stopped replying to emails altogether, including those of Andresen. The creator had disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161" style="max-width: 526px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-161" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg" alt="An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto" width="526" height="419" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto</figcaption></figure>
<p>The name Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be a pseudonym for a person, a group, or even a larger, possibly governmental organization. In Japanese, Satoshi means “clear-thinking” or “wise.” Naka can mean “inside” or “relationship” and moto is used to describe “the origin” or “the foundation.” Put it all together and you get “thinking clearly inside the foundation.” There’s scant evidence that Nakamoto existed outside the context of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>According to his P2P foundation account details, Satoshi claimed to be a 37-year-old male living in Japan. His language of choice was English, but he would alternate between British and American spellings and colloquialisms, which could mean that he was trying to mask his nationality or that Satoshi is actually more than one person. He would post on the forums and respond to emails at random times with no discernible patterns that might indicate a primary time zone.</p>
<p>Based on his limited body of work, we know that Satoshi is highly intelligent and economically competent. He’s a brilliant mathematician, well-versed in cryptography, and a capable programmer, though his code indicates that he most likely wasn’t a professional.</p>
<p>While theoretically sound, his style belied his experience (or lack thereof), leading some, including Andresen, to believe that Satoshi is an academic. A prominent fear in the early days was that some exploitable flaw in the Bitcoin system would eventually surface, undermining the movement. Four years later, the protocol remains bulletproof, a testament to Satoshi’s genius, foresight, and thoroughness. It also suggests that, if he really is a single entity, Satoshi is a hell of a proofreader.</p>
<p>Though it appeared that Satoshi understood that the Bitcoin movement might attract its fair share of ideologues, such as anti-government libertarians, it’s unclear whether or not Satoshi was politically motivated himself. If at times he seemed eager to recruit such groups to the cause, his intent could be interpreted as pragmatic. Keenly aware of the potential social implications of his idea, he left the politicizing to others.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” he wrote. “I&#8217;m better with code than with words though.” We know, based on his writings, that he had qualms with the banking system and saw Bitcoin as a technological solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#8217;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.</p>
<p>A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. Its time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>THE PRIME SUSPECTS</h3>
<p>Analysis of Satoshi’s coding and writing style have been inconclusive. But with the facts available, a few prominent suspects have emerged, some more widely accepted than others.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Andresen</strong>: As the Bitcoin project’s lead developer, he is an obvious choice (though perhaps too obvious by Satoshi’s standards). Andresen serves as chief scientist on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and equivalent of the Linux’s Linus Torvalds. Outside of Satoshi, Andresen has the most influence on Bitcoin’s direction. The mild-mannered programmer’s technical savvy and work ethic is universally admired within the community.</p>
<p>He has sometimes been referred to as Bitcoin’s “Batman” for his altruism and the nature of his often unrewarding role. One Bitcoin developer who has frequently corresponded with Andresen but wished to remain anonymous, claims conversational similarities between the two, though this has been disputed. Could Satoshi be hiding in plain sight?</p>
<p>Andresen denied being Satoshi when we broached the question over the weekend at the 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose, saying he has a different coding style than Satoshi does.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Clear, Donal O’Mahony, Hitesh Tewari and Michael Peirce of Trinity College, Dublin</strong>: An investigation by Joshua Davis of the New Yorker ultimately led to Michael Clear, a then 23-year-old graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College. Despite his age, Clear appeared to check enough boxes to fit the bill. Named Trinity’s top computer science student in 2008, Clear had co-authored a paper on peer-to-peer cryptography. He was also British. Davis tracked Clear down at the Crytpo 2011 conference in Santa Barbara where Clear denied the allegations. “I&#8217;m not Satoshi,” he said. “But even if I was I wouldn&#8217;t tell you.” (That refrain is common in the Satoshi search.)</p>
<p>Davis’s report prompted further digging among the community, which led to Donal O’Mahony, a professor at the university; Hitesh Tewari, a research assistant; and Michael Peirce, a student, because of various published materials connecting the four including this paper and this book. Along with Clear, the group has been called the Crypto Mano Group (mano is Irish for coin) or CMG. Perhaps coincidentally, none have publicly discussed Bitcoin in spite of their relevant body of work.</p>
<p><strong>Neal J. King, Charles Bry, and Vladamir Oksman</strong>: The New Yorker piece prompted Adam L. Penenberg of Fast Company to conduct his own search for Bitcoin’s mysterious creator. A textual analysis of Satoshi’s whitepaper led Penenberg to a patent application, which shared the term &#8220;computationally impractical to reverse.&#8221; To Penenberg’s surprise, the patent had been filed just three days before the domain Bitcoin.org was registered.</p>
<p>All three have filed patent applications that have to do with encryption, communication, networks, and nodes. All three have also denied being Satoshi, with King going as far as shooting down the concept. “It’s not a very good idea,” King told Penenberg. “Nakamoto’s algorithm is a solution in search of a problem.”</p>
<p>King has been consistent with his skepticism. His latest comment at the Economist continues his argument as to why Bitcoin won’t work: “It never makes contact with the physical world, except through the concepts of credulous dreamers that have not quite woken up.” Knowing Satoshi, however, it could be a ploy to cover his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong>: McCaleb’s name is often brought up during discussions of Satoshi’s identity. The UC Berkeley dropout co-founded Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo—a questionable decision given Japan’s high corporate tax rate and regulatory red tape. This has led some to cite this as evidence of a tenuous affinity for the country without McCaleb actually being Japanese. McCaleb also founded eDonkey in 2000, one of the largest (and technically revered) peer-to-peer file-sharing networks at the time.</p>
<p>He would later sell the highly profitable Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, saying that while the service was “cool and needed to exist,” it was no longer “technically interesting.” Once an enthusiastic Bitcoin supporter, McCaleb had also become disillusioned by the protocol’s system of mining “because it wastes so much energy.” He would go on to develop Ripple, what he believes to be an improved iteration of the Bitcoin concept that addresses some of these flaws. Could this have been what Satoshi meant when he said he had “moved on”?</p>
<p><strong>Shinichi Mochizuki</strong>: A recent feature on the Japanese mathematician has prompted Nelson, among others, to speculate that the eccentric genius had, while solving the famed ABC Conjecture, one of math world’s most complex problems, created Bitcoin in his spare time. It’s tough to question Mochizuki’s abilities and the patterns seem to fit.</p>
<p>Like Satoshi, Mochizuki released his ABC Conjecture proof on the internet (instead of established academic channels) and simply walked away, refusing to explain his potentially historic work to the great frustration of mathematicians everywhere. Mochizuki is also a native English speaker, though it’s unclear if he can code or is knowledgeable in cryptography. But given Mochizuki’s mathematics acumen and incredible smarts, it’s not impossible to believe he taught himself along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong>: A conspiracy theorist’s wet dream, another idea that gets tossed around is that Bitcoin is the product of some government or governmental agency. From that vantage point, resources are no longer an issue. But why? The answer is more of an intellectual exercise than actual theory.</p>
<p>Bitcoin could be used as a weapon against the US dollar. It could be used to fund black ops, sort of like a currency version of onion routing, which was first developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. It could be used to strategically trim the overweight financial sector.</p>
<p>If governments believed a widely used digital currency was inevitable, Bitcoin could be a preemptive strike against a potentially malevolent iteration. From the US perspective, it could have been created as a hedge against the waning international power of the dollar, though given the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, this seems unlikely. The same could be said about the EU and the flailing euro. Along these lines, some have pointed to EU directives on digital currencies that were implemented and voted for well before Bitcoin became widely known as a possible clue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scariest theory of all is that Bitcoin is actually an Orwellian vehicle that would allow governments to monitor all financial transactions. Bitcoin is often touted for its anonymity, but the transparent nature of the blockchain means every transaction is potentially traceable. Even if each transaction is only associated with a key, armed with enough information, certain organizations would eventually be able to connect the dots. In theory, anyway. In reality, government involvement isn&#8217;t likely, though by no means an impossibility.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE DON’T KNOW</h3>
<p>In the end, we’re right back where we started: a few theories, some circumstantial evidence, and nothing remotely conclusive. It takes only brief examination of his essentially perfect execution of the Bitcoin protocol to realize that Satoshi Nakamoto would treat his quest for privacy with the same level of comprehension. He is a master of the long game.</p>
<p>And no wonder. The creators of e-gold were charged with &#8220;conspiracy to engage in money laundering&#8221; and the &#8220;operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business&#8221; in July of 2008, just months before Satoshi unveiled Bitcoin. Given the treatment of guys like Julian Assange and Kim Dotcom, there’s little upside to being an internet hero when your platform has the potential to disrupt governments and big business.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the possibility that Satoshi could make a comeback at some point. Some within the community assume he is keeping an eye on things, but could re-emerge, if necessary, to right the ship.</p>
<p>“He could kind of step in and say, ‘This is bad.’ It could happen,” a Bitcoin developer told me. “And he would absolutely have enough sway. His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.”</p>
<p>Satoshi could then verify it was him by signing a message to one of his keys from his genesis block. Until then, it’s clear he’s quite content keeping his identity a secret.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>On June 1, a team of six splashed down 63 feet beneath the ocean surface to shack up in Aquarius, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/motherboard-tv-inside-nasa-s-spectacular-undersea-mission-to-save-earth-from-an-asteroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world’s only underwater lab</a>, located off the coast of Florida. They’ll be down there for 31 days, surfacing only on July 2.</h3>
<p>“<a href="http://mission-31.com/about-mission-31/our-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission 31</a>” will mark the longest stretch spent in the ocean base, and will allow the aquanauts (a title given only to those who stay underwater long enough to get used to the pressure) to conduct prolonged research on the coral reef and its inhabitants, as well as to study the impact underwater living has on themselves.</p>
<p>The expedition is led by Fabien Cousteau, the grandson of the well-known French oceanographer and scuba visionary Jacques Cousteau, and builds largely on his family legacy. Back in the 60s, Jacques Cousteau helped create an underwater habitat called Continental Shelf Station Two, or Conshelf Two, which forms the setting for his documentary <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cIjgL2lkwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Without Sun</a></em>.</p>
<p>Following in his footsteps, Fabien Cousteau is now on the seabed, and you can take a peek at what he’s getting up to yourself via <a href="http://mission-31.com/watch-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream videos</a> on the Mission 31 website. (One had no signal earlier, but I can assure you all was well. I guess living at the bottom of the ocean leads to a few technical glitches here and there.)</p>
<p>I arranged to talk to Fabien by Skype—which apparently works quite successfully so long as the ocean surface isn’t too rough. When we spoke this morning, at 6:30 Florida time, the light was just starting to creep into the submerged dwelling and I could see fish swimming across the porthole behind him. Some of his teammates were already out diving; scientists from Florida International University, which operates Aquarius, were collecting their samples.</p>
<p>I asked Cousteau more about his research, and what it’s like to live underwater.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Let’s start with the why. Why did you want to spend a whole month underwater?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Fabien Cousteau: Well, there’s a couple of reasons. First of all it gives us a full lunar cycle to do science, and that is a very rare if not unique thing, especially here at the world’s only underwater marine research centre. So it gives us 31 days to really gather the amount of data you would gather in a whole year from, say, a boat. It’s very, very efficient to be at the world’s last frontier, in our ocean.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s symbolic. My grandfather in 1963 had built an underwater village called Conshelf Two where his team lived and worked for 30 days, collecting all sorts of specimens and data outside in the water column. So we’re planning on collecting data—and in fact they’re out there right now—on things like the effects of climate change, pollution issues, as well as predator-prey behaviour, and we’re working with Florida International University as well as Northeastern University and MIT to do so.</p>
<figure id="attachment_169" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401978985659494.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-169" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401978985659494.jpg" alt="Fabien Cousteau. Image: Mission 31" width="2000" height="1500" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fabien Cousteau. Image: Mission 31</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So what’s changed since your grandfather’s Conshelf 2 mission?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Certain things have changed and some things have stayed the same. For example, the general concept of living underwater in a habitat is fairly similar, and some of the ways we get our equipment are also fairly similar. As a matter of fact, back in those days they used to use pressure pots they used for cooking to bring things down to the habitat from the surface, just to keep it dry and to keep it away from pressure issues. We’re doing the same exact thing, except our pressure pots of course are much more robust.</p>
<p>We’re also using much more modern technology in the Aquarius habitat—for example, you and I are chatting via wifi from 63 feet beneath the surface of the sea, which back in those days was just not possible! This allows us to do an education outreach program, to talk to students and schools and universities, as well as aquariums and museums, and individuals from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>We can actually share our expedition live, for the first time in a Cousteau expedition, in real time, which is really an invaluable tool that we take for granted up on land. Now that we’re sea-dwellers, this is a very new tool for us.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve got some mod cons, then, but what are the main challenges of living underwater?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Well, we only have wifi when the seas are calm and Mother Nature cooperates with us! But we’re used to that: That’s adventure, that’s exploration, and that’s part of the story. The challenges—we’ve been getting along very well. It is a tight space; Aquarius is about the size of a school bus, or 45 feet long by nine feet wide, within which six of us are living for 31 days along with our equipment and our food, and basically everything that we need for that month.</p>
<figure id="attachment_170" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979012228978.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-170" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979012228978.jpg" alt="The aquanauts in Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans" width="2000" height="1333" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The aquanauts in Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What&#8217;s your daily routine?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Our days lately have been getting up between four and six AM, diving six to ten hours a day, and going to sleep around 11 at night, and of course there are tasks all throughout the day.</p>
<p>We’re using cutting-edge scientific technologies including handheld three-dimensional sonographic sonar systems, which allow a video picture even though it’s through audio, which basically means that we don’t need light to be able to see the coral reef. We’re very excited about that because it’s less invasive and we’re able to study the coral reef in a way that’s never been done before.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What research are you working on right now?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">We’re working on several very pertinent topics for our own species, which are of course the effects of climate change and resulting ocean permutation, and what that does to a coral reef, which is the rainforest of the sea.</p>
<p>We’re looking at certain aspects of pollution and run-off, including of course fertiliser and other chemicals, on coral, to see what that does and how quickly it influences individual corals. We’re also looking at something called predator-prey fear behaviour, which is simply how fish react that are feeding and are hungry to predators. When do they basically take the chance in order to get that meal?</p>
<p>Beyond this, of course, we’re looking at ourselves. I have my sleep watch right here; we’re looking at the sleep cycles that are happening, because we have very limited light down here and of course light affects sleep pattern. Beyond that there’s a lot of anecdotal looks at how an individual lives and is affected by living underwater for such an extended period of time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_171" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979032359575.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-171" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979032359575.jpg" alt="Fabien Cousteau arriving at Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans" width="2000" height="1055" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fabien Cousteau arriving at Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And you mentioned you’re diving for up to ten hours a day—How is it possible to dive for so long without getting sick, at that depth?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I like your question, because that’s something that’s often overlooked. The most advantageous part of living under the sea is the fact that, if you live in a habitat, you become saturated in this pressure, which allows the luxury of being able to dive for such lengthy periods of time without any additional issues that you would have diving down from the surface. So that allows us to go out into the water all of those hours, whereas if you’re coming down from the surface you have very limited bottom time because of all the decompression obligations.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin, of course, is once we’re done here we have to stay down here for the entirety of the mission and then go through a very lengthy decompression process, 18 and a half hours, in order for us to reach you surface-dwellers.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’re still in your first week now. How’s it going?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The first four days have been a learning curve on what to expect, how to feel, what the routine is in such a tight environment with six people, and I think we’re getting to a place now where we’re very efficient with our time, we’re putting on our gear very quickly, we’re getting out into the water very quickly, and we’re getting a lot of scientific data. We’re doing a lot of outreach, and by and large we’re getting a lot of great imagery that we’re sharing live on <a href="http://mission-31.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission-31.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine trying to throw a dart at a bullseye that’s 200 feet away with only your bare hands. Now, add a blindfold to the equation. Theoretically, it might be possible. But practically, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible—about the same odds as trying to break a new form of software protection called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation—similar in nature to a technology IBM has patented called homomorphic encryption—is one of the possible futures of cryptography. The main idea behind it is relatively straightforward: through some arcane math, a team of six cryptography experts have figured out that it’s possible to mask code, making it nearly impenetrable to hacks, while at the same time still being possible to run as useful software.</p>
<p>“Traditional encryption is about securing data,” said Dr. Dan Boneh, an encryption expert at Stanford. “Obfuscation is about securing software—a very different notion than encryption.”</p>
<p>The obfuscator works like this. A developer would code a piece of software, and then for added security, run it through a typical garbler, as most commercial software is these days. Following that, the developer would run the garbled software through the indistinguishability obfuscator—think of it kind of like an encryption application.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The obfuscator takes a part the garbled code and mixes random elements together in such a way that when the obfuscated program is run in its intended fashion, the randomness is negated, and the intended output is generated. If the program is told to do something other than what its designer intended, it won’t work.</p>
<p>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it,” Boneh said.</p>
<p>Today most closed source code is obfuscated to some degree—not directly accessible to prying eyes. But, such code is nearly always hackable given enough resources, cryptography expert Dr. Zachary Peterson told me over the phone. And online, most code is openly embedded in web pages, and can be easily studied. That’s why being able to use indistinguishability obfuscation to create “black box” software is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dr. Amit Sahai—one of the researchers who made the breakthrough, and who has been working on the obfuscation for 17 years—took pains to explain that despite catchy headlines, the claim obfuscation would make software “unhackable” isn’t accurate. The reality is that it still would be possible to crack—just that with current technology it would be damn hard.</p>
<p>“You might get lucky and hit the dart board, it’s just a hell of a lot harder,&#8221; he said. (The dart board thing was my metaphor, but Sahai said it was a good one so we sort of talked around it.)</p>
<p>It’s important to note that right now this new form of software obfuscation is completely impractical to use, Sahai said. It would take weeks, or months to receive a meaningful result from querying an obfuscated program. That’s mostly because of computing power, and the incredibly complex calculations necessary to run obfuscated code.​</p>
<p>“We have the first mathematical approach,” he said, “This isn’t coming in the next couple of years to say the least.”</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UroIzjhTCEY?rel=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Still, having the ability to develop black box software would allow tight controls on what it’s used for, and potentially could ensure a greater amount of privacy for people using cloud services such as Gmail. For example, if the email service’s ad-serving software package were obfuscated, it would be impossible for either Google or third parties to do anything other than check email keywords and select which ads were served, Sahai explained.</p>
<p>(Of course, for that particular example to succeed, Sahai said you’d have to be willing to trust that Google programmed the black box to do what they claimed it did.)</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation could be used to plant controls on digital and real-world surveillance technologies. For example, if you’re worried that red light cameras can also double as license plate readers—a controversial technology that the ACLU says may infringe on Americans’ liberties—obfuscated software scanning the images could ensure they would be used only for their apparent purpose—doling out red light tickets.</p>
<p>Another example of its use, also having to do with government accountability, is this: Were the NSA to build an obfuscated black box into a surveillance software packages such as XKeyscore, it could theoretically force agents to use XKeyscore for specific purposes—whether that means preventing XKeyscore searches on American citizens, or whatever other predefined limitations deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Also, inevitably, obfuscation would end up making into the future generations of malicious programs such as malware, remote access trojans, and other hacker tools. While it wouldn’t make malware any tougher to capture, once a researcher does end up getting their hands on it, they will have a much harder time cracking the black box open, Sahai said, and therefore may make it harder to build defenses against.</p>
<p>Those are only a few possibilities of the uses for obfuscation that I discussed with the security researchers I interviewed for this report. There are numerous others including email encryption (by handing over a black box to a friend that can decrypt messages), shorter and more efficient digital signatures—used to sign software patches, for example, which sounds simple but is actually tough and important—as well as solve dozens of what cryptographers call open problems.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges ahead, Sahai pointed out that when RSA’s first encryption schemes came out in the 1970s they were totally impractical as well. Today, they’re seamlessly integrated into machines. Peterson said that while the concept still needs to be proven, the potential is intriguing.</p>
<p>“It’s worth approaching with a healthy sense of skepticism,” Peterson said. “But as far as I can tell cryptographers are excited about its possibilities.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Five million dollars is a hefty grant for any academic to receive, let alone a philosopher. And yet that’s exactly what UC Riverside philosophy professor <a href="http://www.philosophy.ucr.edu/people/faculty/fischer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Martin Fischer</a> received last year for a project that will involve dozens of scientists, philosophers, and theologians from around the world to examine a subject that is probably unknowable: immortality.</h3>
<p>With a subject as ephemeral and amorphous as immortality, one wonders what answers we can reasonably expect for the $5 million price tag. Fischer doesn’t propose to determine whether god exists (he is, himself, a non-believer) or heaven is real. But there’s plenty to work with. Human immortality is a broad subject. It is science and religion. It is futurism and conservatism. It comprises biology, cybernetics, philosophy, theology, cosmology, and quantum physics.</p>
<p>The scope of <a href="http://www.sptimmortalityproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Immortality Project</a> reflects that boundlessness. On June 1, Fischer and a panel of judges will announce their choice of 10 winning proposals offered by physical scientists from around the world, each of whom will receive about $250,000. Judges are still sifting through the roughly 75 proposals they’ve received. But Fischer gave a few indications of what we might expect in a phone interview I conducted with him last week.</p>
<p>One scientist, he said, has proposed to study the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=hydra+immortal&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C33&amp;as_sdtp=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydra</a>, whose cells replicate indefinitely without deteriorating; several others would examine the neurophysiology of the near-death experience. “There are some interesting proposals looking at how people’s beliefs about the afterlife affect certain things like their ethical behavior, their criminal behavior,” he said.</p>
<p>Other projects might examine “the relationship between afterlife beliefs and economic behavior and longevity,” he added. “There’s a lot of really interesting stuff out there.”</p>
<p>The hard science is just part of the inquiry. In June 2014, judges will disburse a second allotment of $1.5 million among a group of philosophers and theologians to think and write about immortality’s more rarefied aspects. (The remaining million pays for administrative costs like maintaining a website and organizing conferences). Fischer hopes to have the project, which is funded by the John Templeton Foundation, wrapped up for a culminating conference in the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>I chatted with Fischer for over an hour about the project. As expected, the conversation got pretty meta.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">In your writings, you use logic to dispute the idea of god; there’s also a deep, implicit acceptance of the reality of death. How did that lead you to want to study immortality? It seems antithetical to those conclusions.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The context that I’m interested is death and what comes after death—if anything—in all its aspects. The basically secular view is what I’ve adopted in many of my writings, which says that when we die we go out of existence. We don’t have any further experiences. [But if we assume] death is a bad thing for the individual who dies—even if it’s just experiential nothingness—then one might wonder whether immortality might well be a good alternative. That’s how they fit together in my mind.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve said several proposals under review would examine the near-death experience. I actually thought we had closed the door on that. Neurologist Kevin Nelson, in his book, The Spiritual Doorway in the Brain, suggests phenomena like the light at the end of the tunnel and hallucinations are all about reduced blood flow, among other things. In the research you’re planning will you assume the phenomena are physiological or are you leaving the door open to the supernatural?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">There are some people who take it that near-death experiences provide evidence of the falsity of materialism about the mind. They take it that near-death experiences provide a glimpse into an afterlife. They actually take it that these near-death experiences provide good evidence that we have to adopt a completely new paradigm of the mind and consciousness. I’m inclined to the view that there will be adequate neurophysiological explanations of all the phenomena. I don’t think we’re there yet. I don’t think we have them yet, they’re just hypotheses.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>That there was a beginning to the universe doesn’t really affect the issue of immortality. But that there must at some point be an end to the universe—it’s hard to get one’s mind around.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think where we are now is kind of exciting because I think everybody agrees that people are sincere about their reports. They have these experiences and the question is “what do they mean?” or “what do they indicate?” I’m open to the possibility that we won’t be able to fully explain it. But my default assumption is naturalistic and scientific, and I would like to see more and more understanding—a better understanding of the underlying brain processes in these experiences.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Does the news about the Higgs boson—specifically its implication that the known universe may have an expiration date—shape your thoughts about immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>My view is, first of all, it doesn’t bother me at all that there was a beginning to the universe. That doesn’t really affect the issue of immortality. But that there must at some point be an end to the universe—it’s hard to get one’s mind around. It seems like the heat death would take place many billion years from now.I should first say that I’m not an expert on physics and I don’t fully understand the implications of the Higgs boson discovery, although, you know, people do talk about limits on the temporal extension—they talk about the sun flickering out eventually or heat death.</p>
<p>And I’m assuming the constraints of the Higgs boson also would take place billions and billions of years from now. So I’m of the opinion that, instead of strict immortality, we could focus on extreme longevity—billions and billions of years of longevity. And I think the same issues would come up.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Yeah, billions of years is a long time—pretty much inconceivable.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The debate would reinscribe itself. So people would say “yes, that would be great,” they would want it. Others would say “no, it would be inevitably boring or alienating or not a recognizably human life.”</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Is it conceivable that there’s a version of immortality that exists as something outside the limits of the known universe, or do you have to be religious to believe that?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>I guess you wouldn’t have to be religious. You could believe that there are forces or energies or features of the physical universe which we haven’t yet identified or can’t yet fully describe—that there was a kind of [true] immortality that wouldn’t have to be religious. That’s possible. It’s kind of an abstract possibility that we can’t really grasp concretely right now. But I think it’s possible and there’s lots that we don’t know.</p>
<p>If you think about quantum mechanics and string theory and you try wrap your mind around the possibility that there are many, many dimensions to reality, not just three or four, it starts becoming very hard to comprehend. We have certain concepts of present, past, future, causation, physical objects, acceleration, velocity, location. We apply those ordinary concepts to our ordinary lives and they work pretty well, you know? But once you start thinking about quantum mechanics, string theory, the ordinary concepts just don’t apply anymore. And maybe there is a kind of immortality that we have genuinely as part of the physical universe that we can’t yet understand.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Or even beyond the physical universe…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yeah, beyond the physical universe that we know about. There are philosophers who are dualists who think that the mind is not identical to the brain. Or, if they’re property dualists, they think that mental properties are non-physical properties of our brains. And if you think that maybe the universe has non-physical properties, maybe immortality is somehow related to those.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Is there a basic incompatibility between free will and immortality? And I mean true immortality, not putting my brain in a jar for extreme longevity.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Well, I’m going to answer another question first, then I’ll get back to your question. I definitely think that immortality in the sense of living forever and not dying is completely consistent with free will. Now, if you add that determinism is true or that god exists then it might rule out certain kinds of freedom but I think it’s still consistent with other kinds of freedom and it’s consistent with moral responsibility. Now, true immortality, especially as conceptualized in a religious view—I don’t think that’s typically thought of as involving free will.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>There are some people who take it that near-death experiences provide evidence of the falsity of materialism about the mind. I’m inclined to the view that there will be adequate neurophysiological explanations of all the phenomena.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think about the standard Christian picture, in which you’ve been virtuous in life and you go to heaven and you have eternal union with god, that’s typically not a context in which you have freedom of the will. You’re in a blissful union with god forever, but you don’t have the freedom to choose evil. You’re not conceptualized as planning and acting in accordance with your plans.</p>
<p>It’s different in Buddhist views and Hindu views where you have reincarnation—where after you die you still live a life and you can have free will. The Islamic picture is the garden. It’s very sumptuous and lavish with fountains and sensual pleasures. I’m not enough of an Islamic scholar to know if you’re supposed to be acting with free will there or just enjoying great sensual pleasures, but it’s a different kind of picture from heaven. Heaven in the Judeo-Christian tradition is more of an intellectual or thetic realm.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Isn’t the dualistic Christian notion of heaven and hell just an attempt to reconcile the idea of free will here on earth with the idea of immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes. I think that’s correct. But what’s interesting here is, you know, there are these more complicated pictures where on some views you have an opportunity to exercise your free will even after you die.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">It sounds great.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">It’s kind of interesting because, on the Christian picture, free will is such a central part of the importance and meaningfulness of our lives on earth. It’s really what distinguishes us from mere animals. It’s interesting that heaven’s supposed to be an ideal place and yet heaven does not contain that feature that is so important to the meaningfulness of our lives. When we get to the next round of competition, maybe someone will explore that issue.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">I wrote a story recently which showed that neurons—like the hydra —may live indefinitely when unattached to the mortal confines of their host bodies, a discovery that seems to bring that brain-in-a-jar scenario a bit closer. Futurists like Ray Kurzweil believe we will have achieved immortality—or at least super-long term longevity— in about 40 years. What do you think?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’m very interested in this and it’s definitely within the scope of the grant. We have proposals on jellyfish, hydra and related biological creatures. There are also interesting studies of certain worms that reproduce asexually. And so biologists are looking at these creatures with the possibility of making discoveries that could help us cure aging. Kurzweil isn’t really a biologist; he’s a futurist and an entrepreneur. But, yes, he’s a big proponent of supplementation and enhancements of various kinds…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Yes, cybernetics—couldn’t that be part of this picture?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Yes, eventually. Kurzweil and others believe that at some point we will have achieved a biological status where we could still be run over by a truck or hit by a meteorite or die in a fire but we would be medically immortal. We wouldn’t age or die of natural causes. And, once we get to that point, we’ll be able to live long enough that eventually we’ll be able to upload the contents of our minds into computers or cybernetic devices.</p>
<p>I, myself, am skeptical that this will be achieved in the near future. I think 40 years is probably optimistic. I’m also humble enough about these things to know that we’ve been wrong before about the possibility of scientific progress. But I am struck by the fact that you can go in for a simple operation and it can go wrong. So I’m a bit more skeptical.</p>
<p></p>

Image via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Good point. But let’s assume we do achieve biological immortality someday. It seems like any individual action we perform would matter a lot less. Does it in some way absolve us our moral responsibilities toward one another if we all live forever?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">No, it doesn’t at all. I think that if we could all live forever we would still have to treat each other with respect and dignity. It would still be wrong to cause people pain and suffering or violate their right to privacy or religious expression or freedom of speech. I think ethics in basic ways wouldn’t change. If I know I’m medically immortal and I know others—maybe my friends or maybe everyone is like that—it doesn’t make it ok for me to treat them like dirt or to violate their rights or cause them pain.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And when we talk about biological immortality, we often talk about it as though it would be accessible to everyone all at once. But I always think about how much sharper the class divide might be if some humans could afford to become immortal while others couldn’t.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>That’s an excellent point. Since forever, human beings have wanted immortality. It literally goes back to the first epic that’s ever been written, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh lost his friend Enkidu, who died, and Gilgamesh went on a quest for the secret to immortality. We’ve always wanted it. But there’s also been a counter-narrative that it’s overreaching, that it’s asking for too much, it’s not reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>I, myself, am skeptical that biological immortality will be achieved in the near future. I am struck by the fact that you can go in for a simple operation and it can go wrong.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>One part of the reflection on immortality is the realization that it’s not really feasible for everyone to have it. Because if everyone had it there would be overpopulation. If everyone were immortal and their children were immortal there would be no resources left, there would be overcrowding. You can tell stories about colonies on other planets but, short of that, it seems like there would be constraints toward just having an elite or small group of immortal people. And that raises questions about equity and fairness and class.</p>
<p>I look at a genre like the vampire genre as bringing this out because the vampires are achieving immortality at the expense of others. They’re exploiting others to get immortality. It brings up questions about justice and fairness in achieving immortality in a metaphorical way.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">One imagines a kind of scenario where humans who gain immortality begin believing they are somehow more human than the poor schlubs who can’t. I worry that some humans become more expendable than they were before. They’re better cannon fodder for wars. Better for to shine the immortals’ shoes.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Say more about that…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Well, suppose immortality is available only to a certain economic, cultural and social elite—basically the people who can afford it and who have access. We’re not talking about people in the slums of Mumbai and we’re also not talking about people in the project towers here in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Well that’s right. Just as a matter of fact there are people who are seeking immortality through cryogenics in America and it’s very expensive. I don’t know exactly how much, but it tends to be sought by very wealthy people. There are a lot of billionaires from Texas who want cryogenics. People in the inner cities or the slums of Mumbai are not going to be able to afford all that’s required for cryogenics. Also, they’re not going to be able to afford anti-aging medicine, supplementation, all the medicines people take to lower their cholesterol to ideal levels and everything.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing: The rich tend to have lives that they really want to continue. The poor have generally taken refuge in a different kind of idea, and that is the afterlife. With Christianity, that’s been one of the great things about it as an institution. It’s given hope to the downtrodden. If you think of the African-American church in America, it’s a great example of giving hope in the face of poverty and injustice. But the hope is not to live forever and not die. The hope is to have an afterlife in which justice is achieved.</p>
<p></p>
<figure id="attachment_188" style="max-width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Soldier_Vampire_by_Lostinfog88.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-188" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Soldier_Vampire_by_Lostinfog88.jpg" alt="The vampire: Metaphor for the rich, immortals that will one day enslave us proles.

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And the elite become, like a vampire, something of a different—albeit humanoid—species. An immortal human is, at least in a fundamental or philosophical way, a different species, right?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve written about death as being “bad” because it deprives us of things we know we will enjoy. But is it possible that one reason we enjoy things is that we know they won’t last? I think of Dorian Gray’s constant ennui. Proust writes a lot about the dissatisfaction in love that comes right after one possesses the object of his desire. Would we even enjoy immortality after a while?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Yes. Well…that’s a great question. I think Heidegger is famous also for arguing that our awareness of our own finitude structures our lives, kind of gives it meaning, makes everything precious and urgent. And that, without it, our lives wouldn’t have that meaningfulness. I think that insofar as you really love someone—really, intensely, genuinely love someone—you don’t want to lose that person. You don’t want it to end. And you’ll go to great lengths to maintain the beauty and intimacy of the relationship and not let it dissipate and not let it end.</p>
<p>I think love has in it kind of an internal logic or impetus to continue. It’s so painful when you break up with someone you love or you lose a friend. And it’s so painful because you want it to last forever. There’s this very poignant phenomenon, and it’s very anecdotal, but I’ve definitely heard of various instances of it, and that is when people who have been married for a long time, when one of the members of a couple dies it’s not uncommon for the other one to die shortly thereafter for no apparent physical reason. They die from heartbreak, basically.</p>

<p>There is a lot of beauty and dignity to human beings and to great love. My father recently passed away and I watched my mother take care of him for a long time. And there’s just an incredible beauty to that. And the whole idea that somehow love would dissipate if we were immortal, I don’t accept that.</p>
<p>In a finite life, yes, there are challenges already—big challenges in keeping a relationship vital and passionate. Even couples who love each other very much often fall into patterns and habits and take each other for granted. So that would also be a challenge in an immortal life. You’d have to work on it, just like you’d have to work on it in a finite life.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Love isn’t a metaphor here: it’s a specific reason to want to keep living forever.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>I think it’s one of the great reasons for living. It’s clearly one of the central ways in which our lives get meaning and more richness and become more rewarding for us. I think if we couldn’t have love and intimate friends in an immortal life, that would really be a problem. But, if we can, you could even imagine the same intimate friends or the same spouse forever.</p>
<p>Think about this: It’s so painful to lose someone you’ve known as a friend or a lover you’ve been together with for 30 or 40 years, imagine how it would be to lose someone if you’ve been together hundreds of years or thousands of years. That would give more incentive to work at your marriages and your friendships in an immortal life.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Caring about life, per se, doesn’t really mean anything. The only life worth living is a life with love in it…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes.</p>
