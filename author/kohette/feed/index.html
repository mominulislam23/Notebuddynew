<p style="color:#313131;font-size:24px" class="has-drop-cap">Early on a Saturday morning 60 years ago, the millennia-old dream of spaceflight came true as Sputnik 1 rocketed into orbit to become Earth&#x27;s first human-made satellite. The mission notoriously shocked the world and minted a new era of human exploration, but what&#x27;s less well-known is that Sputnik arose, in part, from a 19th century dream to raise the dead. Really.</p>



<p style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee" class="has-background">On this day in 1957, the 184-pound spacecraft departed from a modest Kazakh launchpad that would later evolve into the famous Baikonur Cosmodrome, currently the only spaceport on Earth capable of transporting humans to the International Space Station (ISS). The local time of liftoff was 1:28 AM on October 5, but for people living in North American, European, and Western Russian time zones, the launch occurred on Friday, October 4, and history has memorialized that date as Sputnik&#x27;s anniversary.</p>



<p>Sputnik triggered the Space Race, a geopolitically intense and technologically productive phase of the Cold War, which climaxed with NASA&#x27;s six Apollo Moon landings from 1969 to 1972. The Sputnik crisis, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html">a period of Western anxiety</a>about the clear Soviet lead in spaceflight—and its reconnaissance and military implications—jumpstarted American defense, science, and education initiatives that profoundly impacted the course of world events over the subsequent six decades.</p>

</ul>



<p>This explains why the satellite&#x27;s flight is usually framed as the starting shot of a new era, syncing up with the &quot;space race&quot; metaphor. Sputnik is remembered for the world it made, not the world that made it. But the run-up to this mission is as fascinating as its fallout, and weaves together the stories of visionary thinkers against the tumultuous backdrop of imperial Russia&#x27;s transition into the communist USSR.</p>

<p>As a bonus, if you trace Sputnik&#x27;s origins back far enough, you get spacefaring zombies. It turns out that resurrecting dead people, and sending them to colonize alien planets, was a motivating factor in the development of Russian spaceflight. It began with the futurist philosopher Nikolai Fyodorov (often anglicized as &quot;Fedorov&quot;), who was born in 1829 in the Tambov province of imperial Russia.</p>



<p>Fyodorov believed that humanity needed to be liberated from death to achieve perfection, a view shaped by his Russian Orthodox Christian faith, especially its resurrection stories. Like other transhumanists who have envisioned immortality, Fyodorov speculated about ways to extend lifespans indefinitely, but he also took the premise a lot farther.</p>



<p>It wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent the death of every living person. Every dead person also had to be brought back to life so they could rejoin their descendents in a utopian future. He called this mission humanity&#x27;s &quot;common task.&quot;</p>



<p>In other words, Fyodorov believed that &quot;humanity&#x27;s moral task was to emulate Christ and make bodily resurrection possible,&quot; writes Asif Siddiqi, a space historian based at Fordham University, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rockets-Glare-Spaceflight-Imagination/dp/1107639328">in his book</a> <em>The Red Rockets&#x27; Glare.</em> &quot;Mass resurrection would finally eliminate the artificial boundaries among the &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; of humanity, that is, between the previous and current generations.&quot;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5 Years ago, Brian Trautman dropped the mooring lines of his boat Delos, and left the business World in Seattle behind him. He and his crew planned an epic trip across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand but when they finally got there, they weren’t ready to stop…Asia was beckoning.</p>
<p>Asia at Sea talked to Brian about how this all started and to find out where they are now and how they are getting along.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Tell us about the boat. When and where did you buy her? Did you name her yourself? And if so what does the name mean?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I remember the first time I walked down the dock and saw Delos sitting there. She just screamed out “Take me across an ocean!” . I was living and working in Seattle at the time and had been shopping for a solid, blue water cruising boat for over a year. I went to a bunch of boat shows drooling over everything then heard about the Amel boats from a cruising seminar. At that time there was only one Amel Super Maramu for sale on the West coast of the US. It just happened to be in Bellingham, a few hours drive north of Seattle almost on the Canadian border so I headed up to take a look. They say that when you find your boat you know it, and that’s exactly what it was like. I put in an offer and the sale closed a few months later in June of 2008.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>They say that when you find your boat you know it, and that’s exactly what it was like</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Delos was named by the previous owner and the history goes a little something like this. And I’m paraphrasing here to keep it really short:</p>
<p>Zeus was a bit of a player and was fooling around with Leto. In fact Zeus got her pregnant. Hera found out and banished Leto. This was a problem because apparently the children of gods can’t be born in the human domain. Zeus called in a favor from his bro Poseidon who used his trident to create a magical island named Delos, which was someplace between heaven and earth. Artemis and Apollo were then safely born on the Island of Delos.</p>
<p>I thought it was a pretty sweet story so kept the name!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How did this epic trip start; did you have any initial plans?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Strangely with a trip to the library on a sunny Seattle Day. I was browsing the shelves and saw a book with a bright blue ocean on the cover. I can’t remember the exact title but it was something like “How to cross an ocean on your own boat.” What?!??! Was that even possible to do these days? I’d been sailing small boats around the lakes of Seattle for a few years but the thought of crossing an ocean blew me away. It then occurred to me that this was the ultimate way to travel! A way to mix adventure and self sufficiency with the art of sailing. And so the dream was born. The initial plan was to sail to New Zealand. I spent the next 4 years dreaming, saving, planning, and selling all my worldly possessions.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Delos departed Seattle in August of 2009 and we arrived in New Zealand in October of 2010. There was no way I could stop now so another plan was born to sail to Australia via Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon’s. Most of my savings had been spent by this time so we stretched the budget razor thin to make it happen.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_134" style="max-width: 788px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Delos-Hauled-Out-for-Survey-in-Seattle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-134" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Delos-Hauled-Out-for-Survey-in-Seattle.jpg" alt="Delos Hauled Out for Survey in Seattle" width="788" height="1050" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Delos Hauled Out for Survey in Seattle</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We sailed on and off the anchor to save diesel and lived off fish and rice. It was an amazing experience to see just how cheaply you can live on the ocean. We made it happen and arrived in Australia some 7 months after departing New Zealand. The entire crew was really, really broke so we parked Delos for a while and moved to Melbourne, Australia. At this point the crew was myself, Brady, Josje, and Karin. We weren’t done sailing, just flat out of cash so we all worked to put some money in the cruising kitty. Since we’re not retired that’s what we do to follow our dreams- sail, run out of money, work, sail again. Delos was parked for just over a year in Bundaberg, Australia while we scraped together enough for another season.</p>
<p>In May of 2013 we left Bundaberg and began sailing up the east coast of Australia ending up in Darwin.. Our plan was to sail through Indonesia, The Philippines, Malaysia, and into Thailand. We loved the Philippines so much our plan was blown to smithereens and we ended up spending 8 months there! We only just got into Malaysia and plan to continue sailing west. So basically an initial 18 month plan has stretched to 5 years with no end in sight.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve producing more than two dozen videos of your travels, professionally put together and very entertaining. Where did you learn your skills in videography?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Oh wow, thanks so much! We’re blushing over here! I remember being in Mexico and having a Tequila fueled conversation in Bara de Navidad with a guy I had just met at the bar. He was also traveling and we got to talking about sailing. He insisted that I walk out right then and there and buy a HD camcorder to film stuff non-stop as we crossed the Pacific. I thought at that point maybe it could be a cool project to work on, so I purchased a pretty basic camcorder for about US$200 and started filming.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>At first we just goofed around making stuff with still shots, random video clips, and maybe a few subtitles. When we returned to Delos this season in Australia we wanted to step up our game a notch so we bought a Go Pro and little better HD Camcorder. We got a copy of Adobe Premiere and just went to town on the editing process. It’s been quite a learning experience but A LOT of fun.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve had quite a contrasting crew over the last months. Where did they all come from?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">That has to be the most unexpected surprise about this trip. I never could have guessed so many awesome people would sail on Delos. Since the trip began we’ve had 33 people from 9 different countries sail on Delos. Some have stayed for a only a week while others have stayed for a month or longer. Some are friends and family that have come to visit but most we’ve met while out sailing. Brady is my brother and he got onboard in Mexico to help with the Pacific crossing to Tahiti. He was going to stay a few months but ended up staying 5 years!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Along the way we met Karin (from Sweden) who was backpacking in New Zealand and Josje (from New Zealand) who was sailing on her Uncle’s boat in Fiji. Both were invited to sail for a weekend and never ended up leaving! Most recently we met some amazing people in the Philippines that contacted us through our blog. We spent a few weeks hanging with them and they actually joined us on the passage from The Philippines to Malaysia.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">On camera you all seem to get along very well; is this always the case?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I know it may be hard to believe but we all get on incredibly well. Everyone feels more like family than anything else. We’re all out here to have fun and it’s a pretty low-stress environment most of the time. Even on a 53’ boat you can still find your own space. Just jump off for a swim to the nearest beach, or head up to the bow with your headphones in. It’s your own little world! We have a cooking and cleaning schedule and everyone pulls their own weight onboard which really helps.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You left the business world to go on this venture; do you think you’ll ever go back?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">This trip has changed my DNA in a way I didn’t think possible. There’s no way I could ever go back in the same capacity as before. Delos will continue sailing West and when we end up somewhere and potentially settle down I’ll figure it out then. I’ve learned a lot about what’s important in life and I know it’s not doing the 9-5 rat race!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you have a favourite spot so far in this part of the World?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Wow, that’s the toughest question so far. Each and every place has so many special things about it. I’d say it’s a three way competition between Vanuatu, New Zealand, and The Philippines. In Vanuatu we witnessed the true practices of the local tribes, from war dances to exploding volcanoes. In New Zealand we parked Delos in a marina and explored by land. The beautiful mountains, glaciers, and beaches just blew us away. Of course the Kiwi’s are just a fun loving, adventurous group so we got on real well.</p>
<p>In The Philippines we were blown away by the genuine smiles and friendliness of the people. In every town and every village we met someone that took us under their wing and showed us around. We got pulled into village huts for Tagay with Tanduay and Coke, partied with Filipino seafarers for New Years, rode on the tops of Jeepney’s, and met some lifelong friends that brought us into their homes and showed us the crazy big city of Manila. Plus we really like San Miguel Beer. The Philippines were so much fun our 2 month plan turned into an 8 month adventure!</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Where’s next?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Delos is currently in Sabah, Malaysia (Borneo) and slowly creeping our way West. We’ll hit Singapore, mainland Malaysia, and Thailand before crossing the Indian Ocean to South Africa. But, our plans our written in the sand at low tide and have been known to change!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">If one of our readers is considering embarking on such an adventure, do you have any advice?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Just get out there and do it! Speaking from experience the hardest part is actually cutting the cord and going. I’ve met a lot of people that have been planning for 10 years or even longer. They’re making everything shiny, making covers for everything, then bags to store their covers in, etc. You and your boat will never be 100% ready but at some point you just have to cast off the lines and head out! You probably already know more than you think so just use good common sense. Oh yea- and bring lot’s of sunscreen!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Aubrey de Grey has been called many things. “Transhumanist” is one of them, but one he dislikes. “Immortalist” is the tag used to describe him and his colleague Bill Andrews in a documentary shown at South by Southwest this March, though de Grey rolls his eyes when someone drops the word “immortality.”</h3>
<p>The British gerontologist considers himself a “simple medical researcher,” but his research is about fiddling with cells to stop ageing in human beings, and potentially postponing death indefinitely. If it’s not immortality (in de Grey’s world, you could still be dispatched by an infectious disease or a shotgun), it’s quite a close beast.</p>
<p>He believes that tackling the individual illnesses that haunt old people’s lives is a fundamentally flawed strategy; the right course of action is to act at the cellular level to prevent ageing from setting off those illnesses in the first place. His Silicon Valley-based foundation-cum-laboratory, the SENS Research Foundation, is completely devoted to this feat.</p>
<p>In the past, de Grey’s views were often met with skepticism or hostility, when not openly guffawed at. That has not completely changed, but the idea that ageing should actually be regarded as a disease, and that it might even be treated as such, is increasingly gaining ground. Recently, that&#8217;s been given a boost by research into tackling ageing on a genetic level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_118" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400841202712231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400841202712231.jpg" alt="Aubrey de Grey when I met him in Cambridge. Image: Alessandra Antolini" width="2000" height="1333" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Aubrey de Grey when I met him in Cambridge. Image: Alessandra Antolini</figcaption></figure>
<p>I wanted to ask de Grey how things are going at the frontline of the anti-ageing battle, so we exchanged some emails (he doesn’t carry phones, “ghastly, horrible things that deprive people of essential solitude”), and we finally met in Cambridge last week.</p>
<p>Drinking a pint of ale and tormenting his greying Old Testament-style beard, he initiated me in the science and doctrine of which he’s the standard-bearer, most of which can be summarized in one question: If we could really wipe old age and death off the planet, why shouldn’t we?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">First of all, let’s look at some recent news. A couple of weeks ago, scientists at Harvard linked the circulatory system of a young mouse to that of an older mouse. The result was that some tissues of the old mouse were rejuvenated. What’s the significance of that?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">It’s very important. This whole idea of linking two animals of different ages—it’s called heterochronic parabiosis—to study ageing has been around for a little while now. At SENS, we work very closely with some of the guys who did that at Harvard. Of course, we’re not going to do the same thing to people.</p>
<p>In general, the experiment has led to a very useful discovery: There’s a particular protein in the bloodstream of young individuals, called GDF11, that helps to reactivate certain aspects of cell division in certain parts of the brain. Now, that’s only a small piece of information; there’s lot more that is not yet known. But I expect that, within the next five years, at least another half a dozen similar rejuvenating factors will be discovered.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So is this mice thing the first step to defeat ageing?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t want to quite say that. All we know is that GDF11 can stimulate certain types of cells to divide when they would not previously divide due to old age. Now, cell division is not the whole story of ageing. In fact, sometimes it can be a bad thing to make cells divide more often, because they may be more exposed to cancer. But still, it’s a whole new tool, and it’s very important.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you think that people may be starting to think that ageing is the real enemy?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I do think so, yes. The things that I’ve been saying for years are finally beginning to get understood. People are understanding that diseases of old age are not really diseases: They are aspects of ageing, side effects of being alive. If you want to cure them, what you’ll have to cure is to be alive in the first place—but you can’t actually do it. So we’ll have to take a preventative maintenance approach. That means that we’ll have to identify the various types of molecular and cellular damage that the body does to itself as a side effect of its normal metabolic operation. Once you’ve identified them, which has already been done, you have to find a way to repair that damage and prevent it from developing into a pathology of old age. That’s what I’m working on.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What are you really trying to achieve? Longevity or immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Well, first of all, any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don’t work on longevity, I work on health. And it just happens that, historically, the main thing that kills people is…not being healthy. So healthier people will likely live longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;Don’t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It’s taken; it’s a religious word.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>How much longer? It depends on how much longer we can keep people healthy. The best we can say at the moment is that the human body is a machine. Therefore, it ought to be the case that we can have the same kind of impact on the human body that we already have now on simple manmade machines, like cars. So, as I said, we can rely on preventative maintenance: repairing any damage before it makes the doors fall off. It seems to work really well with cars; we&#8217;ve got one-hundred-year-old cars around now. So, if you do sufficient maintenance, the sky’s the limit. We should be able to maintain the human body in good health indefinitely, however long we like.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So…it’s immortality, right?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Don’t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It’s taken; it’s a religious word. Immortality means zero risk of death from any cause, but I don’t work on stopping people from being hit by trucks. I work on keeping them healthy.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">By the way, what’s your relationship with religion?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I personally have no religious views, but I have sometimes been attacked by religious people, who said that I was playing God. But it’s quite interesting that it’s really easy to get people coming from a religious background to understand that it would be a sin not to work on this. That’s because ageing causes a lot of suffering, and alleviating suffering is something the scriptures told was our duty. I had some success with that argument.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Ok, what about the social and political consequences of this potentially indefinite extension of life you’re aiming at bringing about?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’ve addressed this issue once or twice, and I noticed that the mistake that people always make is that they think I’m saying we would live much longer in a context where nothing else changes. They think like, “The rest of the world will be just like now but everybody will be biologically 25 forever.” That’s obviously complete nonsense. If we just look at the mathematics, before we’ll have anybody living until the age of 200, a lot of things will have happened, and changed. For example, people always panic about paying pensions to people that live longer. But why would you need a pension if you’re healthy? Even the very concept of work won’t exist in the same way, because we’ll probably have more and more automation. Look, we have at least one hundred years before we’ll have any 200-year-old people.</p>
<p>But we should probably start planning everything in advance. Right now, nobody is going to behave as if it’s going to happen. If you actually managed to do it, one day, society would be completely off-guard.<br />
That’s true, but I am not going to tackle each individual problem—pensions, kids, resources—that might arise in a post-ageing society. I prefer to help people focus on the fact that we’ve a problem today, a really rather bad problem. That is that 100,000 people every fucking day are dying of ageing. That’s the important thing, not worrying about hypothetical problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people are programmed to find reasons why it would be a bad idea to defeat ageing. This is mainly because they fear the unknown, since the world would be very different without ageing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;Any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don’t work on longevity, I work on health.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Aren’t you afraid that living for, say, one thousand years, may be boring?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I find this a very sad question. Of all the ridiculous questions I get about defeating ageing, this is the saddest. Anyone who asks that question must have such a miserable life.</p>
<p>I’m not very happy with my life right now, I must admit.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How could you possibly imagine that you could run out of things to do?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I have a long list of things to do if I was to live 1,000 years: just think about all the films you haven’t seen, all the books you haven’t read. And by the time you’re through them, you would have at least another thousand years of backlog.</p>
<p>Apart from anything else, the main thing that people enjoy with life is other people, mutual interaction. And we have seven billion people to interact with. But even if there were only seven million people worth talking with, people don’t stay the same; they change over time, so you’ll never actually get bored.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you define yourself as a transhumanist?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t really like to be called “transhumanist,” it sounds like I’m doing something weird. I’m not doing anything different from any other medical researcher, except that the consequences of what I’m doing might be quite big. I think it’s a mistake to label visionary technologists with something that starts with “trans.” It creates a kind of psychological separation that is really counter-productive.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">But would you do some of the things that some transhumanists advocate, like uploading your mind on a computer?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’m enjoying my body of meat, but if I had no choice I’d certainly be just as happy to continue my existence in another form of hardware, rather than not continuing my life at all. It remains to be seen what’s actually gonna happen. My current suspicion is that uploading, if it’s possible at all, is still a lot harder than the medical approach that my team and I are taking. But I could be wrong, so I’m very happy that there are people exploring alternative methods.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Are you experimenting with any life-extending practice right now?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Sure: I’m doing this interview. I mean, I’m not following any particular diet or practice, because what we have today is quite useless. The most important thing is getting the word out, getting the things to happen sooner, hastening the development of the therapies, rather than trying to use the little we have today.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What are the chances that the two of us are gonna live to a thousand years?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t know, but I’m working on it. It’s going to happen, it’s just a question of when. The work I do is simply speeding up the inevitable.</p>
<p>But it is very important to me, because for every day that I bring forward the defeat of ageing, I’m saving 100,000 lives—100,000 lives: thirty World Trade Centers. And I’m very happy about that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2007, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has maintained a repository of the world’s agricultural heritage. A series of tunnels bored into the side of a mountain, this vault is climate-controlled, secure against tectonic activity or sea-level rise, and designed to hold up to 4.5 million different seed varieties for centuries to come. Built 900km north of Europe in Svalbard, a barren archipelago in Norway, it sits on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, containing duplicate specimens from other seed vaults scattered throughout the world. There are more than 1,000 crop diversity collections worldwide, but the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard was built away from civilisation because it is the fail-safe, the insurance policy, the last resort.</p>
<p>You take a switchback road up a hill to get to the vault, where it juts from the side of a slope a few hundred feet above sea level, looking like a grim, grey tunnel extending out of rock, snow and lichen. Below the entrance is a tiny ravine, and a small bridge one has to cross to reach the vault. Above the vault, Dyveke Sanne’s art installation runs the length of the roof, then spills over the top down the front, ending just above the door. It consists of a series of irregular blue-silver shards, suggesting fractured and disappearing ice. Below this decorative façade, however, is a less welcoming sight: an industrial, slate-coloured door, chained and padlocked.</p>
<p>Unsure exactly what to do, I milled around outside with a few other visitors. We exhaled visible vapour, while taking in the stillness of Longyearbyen, the main settlement on the island. Even in summer, when tourist season is at its height, it’s far from bustling here. You quickly get used to the frigid silence that surrounds you.</p>
<p>Then came the massive whoosh of air from the seed vault, a sudden and powerful exhaust, venting through the building from somewhere deep inside the mountain. A small but steady burst of water came trickling out the bottom of the vault, draining into the ravine below the bridge. After about 30 seconds, both air and water ceased. We stood around a bit longer, taking photographs, discussing what to do next, until the noise returned — about 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, regular and steady. My friend Alia turned to me after a few minutes and said, ‘It’s breathing.’</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has repeatedly evoked a sense of the apocalypse. Everyone from Fox News to Wired magazine has used the unofficial nickname ‘doomsday seed vault’ to refer to the project, and it is routinely described as a last haven and refuge for plant biodiversity should some global catastrophe destroy the world’s crops. ‘The “doomsday” vault is designed to keep millions of seed samples safe from natural and unnatural disasters: global warming, asteroid strikes, plant diseases, nuclear warfare, and even earthquakes,’ National Geographic reported in 2008. Wired, in 2011, referred to it as ‘the world’s insurance policy against botanical holocaust’.</p>
<p>Cary Fowler, the former executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which helped to establish the seed vault, has neither coined nor entirely disavowed, the term ‘doomsday’ as it applies to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault: ‘We believe that in the case of a regional or global catastrophe that this seed vault would prove to be very, very useful,’ he told The Washington Post in 2008. ‘However, it wasn’t primarily with that in mind that we started the planning of this facility.’</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Apocalyptic language works, particularly in an easily distracted culture. It is perhaps the only thing that does work</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This disclaimer aside, ‘doomsday’ remains the word most people associate with the vault, and this shouldn’t surprise us. For the past few decades, it has become increasingly commonplace to discuss the environment in terms of an omnipresent end of the world. Speaking in 1992, the then-senator Al Gore used the phrase ‘the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced’ to describe the shrinking ozone layer. That same year, Time magazine described ozone depletion as an ‘unprecedented assault on the planet’s life-support system’, one that ‘could have horrendous long-term effects on human health, animal life, the plants that support the food chain and just about every other strand that makes up the delicate web of nature. And it is too late to prevent the damage, which will worsen for years to come. The best the world can hope for is to stabilise ozone loss soon after the turn of the century.’</p>
<p>This was a few years after the spectre of nuclear holocaust began to recede, as though the resolution of one man-made threat cleared the way for a new nightmare scenario. Within a few years, the chemical compounds CFCs were banned from use in refrigeration, solvents and aerosols, and the ozone layer — as a talking point, rallying cry, and apocalyptic scenario — all but disappeared from public conversation. But like doomsday clockwork, a new ‘greatest crisis humanity has ever faced’ arrived, this time in the form of global warming.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" style="max-width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sval-bard-seed-bank.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-110" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sval-bard-seed-bank.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Svalbard Seed Bank.

<p>Contemporary culture seems accustomed to hopping from one apocalypse to the next. This isn’t entirely bad in and of itself; the apocalyptic language surrounding the ozone layer hastened action on the CFC ban, just as Rachel Carson’s doomsday prophecies in Silent Spring (1962) accelerated the banning of the anti-malaria insecticide DDT. Apocalyptic language works, particularly in an easily distracted culture. It is perhaps the only thing that does work. ‘The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction,’ Carson said in a speech in 1963. But perhaps Carson had it backwards: perhaps it is our attraction to disaster stories and 11th-hour crises that allows us to focus our attention on nature and to marshal energy towards its preservation in the first place.</p>
<p>Along with the language of catastrophe comes a very specific articulation of time. We think of our relationship to the environment in the immediate. Global warming, we’re told, will decimate all life within our lifetimes, or in our children’s lifetimes. In this way, environmental discourse resembles the ranting of religious millenarians, who stubbornly maintain that the apocalypse will happen on their watch. As of 2010, 41 per cent of Americans say that they expect Jesus to return to Earth by 2050. This obsession with impending disaster suggests that we see nature on a particularly human, individual scale. When we think of environmental damage and the human impact on the ecosystem, we think almost exclusively in the short term. The millennium, be it religious or environmental, is always coming the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Standing opposed to this narrow band of apocalyptic time is ‘deep time’, a sense of scale rooted in geology rather than humanity. The concept of deep time originated with the 18th-century Scottish geologist James Hutton, and was popularised by the American writer John McPhee in his book Basin and Range (1981). For McPhee, the chief attraction of deep time is its ability to move us out of short-term thinking: ‘If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time,’ he wrote. ‘And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.’</p>
<p>The workings of deep time are evident everywhere in Svalbard. In the days prior to my visit to the seed vault, I was out on the open seas with two dozen other artists and writers, travelling around the edge of Svalbard in a three-masted tall ship. We’d worked our way up the western coast of Spitsbergen, the archipelago’s largest island, dipping into the northern fjords before heading back. Again and again, I was impressed by the sheer stillness of the world around us. Aside from a few failed attempts by whalers, there were no permanent human settlements in Svalbard before the late 19th century, and there is no indigenous population here, save the reindeer and the bears. Even today, this place is remarkably devoid of human activity. We sailed around Svalbard’s edge at the height of the tourist season, and we sometimes went for days without seeing another ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A footprint left in the lichen can last for years. Wood used to build 17th-century whaling stations still litters the beaches</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In Raudfjorden, a fjord extending in from the top of Spitsbergen, we rode a zodiac raft out to the Hamiltonbreen glacier. Getting too close to a glacier can be deadly: if it calves, the shard of ice hitting the water can send waves big enough to swamp a small craft. Last year, a piece of ice from a calving iceberg broke off and killed a nearby kayaker. While we were out at sea, another tourist, on a different expedition, was killed when she fell into glacier-cooled water so frigid it triggered an immediate heart attack. As we approached the massive slab of ice, we could see broken-off chunks of it drifting in the water outside the raft. They made a constant crackling noise, like a low, fine static.</p>
<p>Though we were safe from immediate harm, it was less clear whether there was a longer-term menace in all that floating ice. Svalbard contains less than three per cent of the planet’s glaciers, but those glaciers are getting 60-70 mm thinner each year, and annually they add 13 cubic km of icemelt to the ocean, raising it by .035mm per year. None of this is trivial, but neither is it particularly visible or dramatic. When I returned home, a few people asked me if I’d seen evidence of global warming. It was a well-meaning question, but one that made little sense. What would evidence of change look like to a person who’d just arrived in a foreign place? How could I tell what was regular snowmelt, and what was some subtle clue of a catastrophic ecosystem failure? Anyone expecting an on-demand Hollywood apocalypse will be disappointed up here.</p>
<p>‘A glacier is an archivist and historian,’ Gretel Ehrlich wrote in The Future of Ice (2004). ‘It saves everything no matter how small or big, including pollen, dust, heavy metals, bugs, bones, and minerals. It registers every fluctuation of weather… A glacier is time incarnate.’ The time incarnated by a glacier operates on a very different scale, doled out in measurements far too small for humans to witness. The most dramatic videos of climate change — where you can actually see it taking place — are made by time-lapse, a process that converts non-human timescales to those that fit into our narrow perceptual filters. Time-lapse reduces days to seconds, and years to minutes, but the conversion can go the other way as well. When we expand our vision of the natural world from human time to geologic time, our own individual consciousness and the consequences of our action and inaction become thin strata in a geologic archive that contains aeons.</p>
<p>Away from any trace of contemporary civilisation, I had begun to experience time differently. In the land of endless daylight, the sun prowled around the horizon, never rising, never setting. I felt as if I was suspended in a perpetual midafternoon, as though a single day had stretched into two weeks. Time seemed to stop or, at least, to slow to a crawl.</p>
<p>And, in a sense, time does crawl here. In an environment that did not support any human habitation prior to the 20th century, where the permafrost almost entirely arrests decay, a footprint left in the lichen can last for years. Wood used to build 17th-century whaling stations still litters the beaches, and it’s all in surprisingly good condition. These undisturbed remains offer a clue to why the Global Seed Vault is located here on Svalbard. The land itself resists deterioration; even if the building’s climate systems were to fail, nature could help to preserve the seeds. We tend to fixate on the remoteness of the seed vault, a place far away from short-term disasters that might imperil it. But it’s more important to notice its relationship to the landscape around it, a landscape capable of preserving the vault’s contents for hundreds of years, at least as long as the strange wreckage of whaling vessels that sit untouched along the archipelago’s shores. Svalbard resists thoughts that are limited to human time-horizons. Its scale is in millennia, not the current millennium.</p>
<p>The closest thing to direct environmental impact that we witnessed was at Blomstrandhalvøya, across the fjord from the research base Ny-Ålesund. The suffix halvøya means ‘peninsula’, but here it’s a misnomer: the glacier that once tethered Blomstrandhalvøya to Spitsbergen has gradually receded, and in 1991 the peninsula became an island. It won’t be the last; as other glaciers recede, the archipelago itself will calve, as smaller islands ‘break off’ by virtue of the disappearing connective glacier tissue.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A proper relationship to nature might also do well to be stripped of a histrionic sense of perpetual catastrophe</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Blomstrandhalvøya is also home to the abandoned marble mine of New London, built by Ernest Mansfield in 1911, after he convinced the Northern Expedition Company that there was high-quality marble here. There is indeed marble, but it’s of such brittle and poor quality that it literally fell apart on the ships bound for England. After two years, the NEC fired Mansfield and abandoned the settlement.</p>
<p>A hundred years on, the ruins of New London are remarkably well-preserved. The ore carts are overturned and rusted, but still intact, resting next to heaps of marble piled up along the cliffs, as if the next ship bound for England will be arriving shortly. The piles of marble — deliberate, definitive remnants of human work — refuse to be reintegrated into the landscape. The Arctic allows New London to linger as a ruin, a testament to how difficult it is to make a quick buck in a place as inhospitable as Svalbard.</p>
<p>I carried all these chilly, arctic visions back with me to Longyearbyen after our voyage was over. Standing outside the Global Seed Vault, listening to its mechanical, hulking breathing, I thought back to a walrus I’d seen off the northwest coast of Spitsbergen midway through our voyage. The walrus, curious at our presence on the coast of this desolate beach, at the edge of the uninhabitable polar sea, had cruised slowly past us, not more than 20ft from the shore. There was nothing subtle about him: when his head breached, he’d exhale noisily and laboriously, watching us watch him, before taking a heaving breath and disappearing once again below the surface. From this vantage point, you might almost mistake him for a drowning victim, the way his head seemed to pop up just long enough to take a panicked gulp of air before the water enveloped him again. But this is, of course, only a matter of limited perspective. Under the surface, these hulking beasts are graceful beyond measure, artful and elegant in waters only a few degrees above freezing.</p>
<p>Sometimes what seems like a panicked gasp for breath is something else entirely. The lessons of Svalbard are more complex than the simple, immediate apocalypse intimated by the hype surrounding the seed vault. Cary Fowler, its former director, has hinted that the vault’s real work will be more prosaic than the dominant narrative might lead you to believe. As he told The Washington Post in 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re losing crop diversity everyday in very mundane ways. We have many feed banks in the world but virtually none work on a secure multiyear budget and equipment failures and accidents, mismanagement are commonplace. Occasionally a feed bank will get in the way of someone else’s fight. We’ve lost feed banks in Iraq and Afghanistan not because they were a target but because they were in the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>This recognition of the work of seed banks like the one in Svalbard is quotidian, bordering on the banal, and it can help to refocus an attitude towards the environment that sometimes verges on the self-important. A proper relationship to nature must involve a sense of stewardship, to be sure, and a willingness to work for a better tomorrow. But it might also do well to be stripped of a histrionic sense of perpetual catastrophe. Places such as Svalbard can help us to think on a much longer, deeper scale — one in which we are peripheral characters in a drama taking aeons to unfold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The biggest lie about the future is that it&#8217;s going to look much different from today.</h3>
<p>I mean, <em>The Jetsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em> are one thing, but in near-future portrayals—those shown in goofball blockbusters like <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>Minority Report</em>—the world is given a glossy, high-tech makeover. These futuristic landscapes suggest we&#8217;re about to see a bevy of unfathomably large infrastructure investments that will reshape our cities in the next couple decades.</p>
<p>Now take a look outside at your nearest bombed-out road or crumbling bridge. Yeah, your metropolis isn&#8217;t going to be turning into Emerald City any time soon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually going to happen is already happening now: The future will appear, not in leaps and bounds, but on a moving sidewalk, gliding onward just smoothly enough that it doesn&#8217;t shake you into recognition. It&#8217;s still going to take decades for California to complete its futuristic high-speed rail line, for example; when it arrives, it&#8217;s still going to look like a train.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about environmental aesthetics for the past few days, which corresponds with how long I&#8217;ve had Fernando Barbella&#8217;s <a title="Signs from the near future Tumblr" href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signs from the Near Future</a> open on a browser tab. The Barcelona-based creative director started a Tumblr to investigate how the new technologies we dream of will actually begin to subvert our surroundings—which, in our litigious world, mainly means a planet filled with futuristic warning signs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_59" style="max-width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5h6ub579K1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-59 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5h6ub579K1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg" alt="Image: Signs from the near future." width="1280" height="806" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;All selfies taken with your smart contact lenses will be shared in real time with the proper authorities&#8221;. Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;New materials, mashups between living organisms and nanotechnologies, improved capabilities for formerly &#8216;dumb&#8217; and inanimate things&#8230; There a lot of things going on around us!&#8221; Barbella wrote me in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all these advances can be as exciting as disturbing in a way, at the same time, if we think about it,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The fact is all these things are going to cease being just &#8216;projects&#8217; to became part of our reality at some point soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been conditioned to think of the Future, capital F, as something that&#8217;s going to arrive with a bang. But of course that&#8217;s not true. Pithy sentiments like &#8220;every new day is the future&#8221; or whatever, the future is ever-arriving and always evolving. No one is going to flip a switch and suddenly fill our streets with hovercars. (That&#8217;d be rad though!) But one day you&#8217;re going to see an autonomous taxi for the first time and say, &#8220;No shit, those are here now? Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going for that point: many years ago, when we were kids, the visions for the future were at least disconnected from reality: flying cars, strange architecture buildings surrounding us, among other out of its time things,&#8221; Barbella said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_63" style="max-width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5facwSP3S1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-63 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5facwSP3S1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg" alt="&quot;15% off on synthetic burguers!&quot;." width="1280" height="867" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;15% off on synthetic burguers!&#8221;. Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;The real thing is that [the] future is always part of the present times, in a way, and that&#8217;s why I focused on this approach to a near future where we see these technologies coexisting with us in the most ordinary of environments and places,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Our difficulty in seeing progress as discrete events makes it harder for us to institute checks and balances along the way. It&#8217;s not such an issue for a consumer-facing product like Google Glass; Glass appeared, we all marveled—or scoffed—and now we&#8217;re figuring out new social norms as we go along.</p>
<p>But considering future manifestations of power, such perpetual change is harder to grasp. Take full-body scanners at the airport, or location-based <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/blog/maybe-the-most-orwellian-text-message-ever-sent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government text messages aimed at protestors</a>. Both are very futuristic, concerning things in the abstract, but when actually faced with either, the common response is something more like, &#8220;Wait, they can do this now?&#8221;</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t accept the future as an endless slog forward, it becomes a lot harder to draw a line in the sand—largely because we&#8217;re still waiting for that line to arrive. And as we wait for that line—and for the courts to rule on cases regarding technology that&#8217;s already out of date—the framework for the future is constantly being laid around us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_65" style="max-width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-65 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg" alt="tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280" width="1280" height="878" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;We will probably never know how worried the people at the top are about the democratization of new technologies, and all the doors and windows and new paths these things are opening for regular Joes like us,&#8221; Barbella said. &#8220;So we can clearly imagine this near future full of warnings and signs telling us how—or when—to use or not to use these technologies originally designed to improve our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbella said that as the project continues, he hopes to cross it over into the physical world, either with a book or a show, or perhaps by producing signs for real and &#8220;start doing some urban interventions.&#8221; He also said that, despite his project standing as a reminder that we need to wake up with regards to our progress, he maintains a positive outlook on the world to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole responsibility is on us. Not the governments, not the monstrous corporations. They just care about themselves, about being reelected or the bonus they will see at the end of the year,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should always be aware that while we waste time on social media, or going after the latest techno toy, there are people who may need our help, and perhaps we can use both the existing and emerging technologies to do it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine trying to throw a dart at a bullseye that’s 200 feet away with only your bare hands. Now, add a blindfold to the equation. Theoretically, it might be possible. But practically, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible—about the same odds as trying to break a new form of software protection called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation—similar in nature to a technology IBM has patented called homomorphic encryption—is one of the possible futures of cryptography. The main idea behind it is relatively straightforward: through some arcane math, a team of six cryptography experts have figured out that it’s possible to mask code, making it nearly impenetrable to hacks, while at the same time still being possible to run as useful software.</p>
<p>“Traditional encryption is about securing data,” said Dr. Dan Boneh, an encryption expert at Stanford. “Obfuscation is about securing software—a very different notion than encryption.”</p>
<p>The obfuscator works like this. A developer would code a piece of software, and then for added security, run it through a typical garbler, as most commercial software is these days. Following that, the developer would run the garbled software through the indistinguishability obfuscator—think of it kind of like an encryption application.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The obfuscator takes a part the garbled code and mixes random elements together in such a way that when the obfuscated program is run in its intended fashion, the randomness is negated, and the intended output is generated. If the program is told to do something other than what its designer intended, it won’t work.</p>
<p>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it,” Boneh said.</p>
<p>Today most closed source code is obfuscated to some degree—not directly accessible to prying eyes. But, such code is nearly always hackable given enough resources, cryptography expert Dr. Zachary Peterson told me over the phone. And online, most code is openly embedded in web pages, and can be easily studied. That’s why being able to use indistinguishability obfuscation to create “black box” software is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dr. Amit Sahai—one of the researchers who made the breakthrough, and who has been working on the obfuscation for 17 years—took pains to explain that despite catchy headlines, the claim obfuscation would make software “unhackable” isn’t accurate. The reality is that it still would be possible to crack—just that with current technology it would be damn hard.</p>
<p>“You might get lucky and hit the dart board, it’s just a hell of a lot harder,&#8221; he said. (The dart board thing was my metaphor, but Sahai said it was a good one so we sort of talked around it.)</p>
<p>It’s important to note that right now this new form of software obfuscation is completely impractical to use, Sahai said. It would take weeks, or months to receive a meaningful result from querying an obfuscated program. That’s mostly because of computing power, and the incredibly complex calculations necessary to run obfuscated code.​</p>
<p>“We have the first mathematical approach,” he said, “This isn’t coming in the next couple of years to say the least.”</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UroIzjhTCEY?rel=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Still, having the ability to develop black box software would allow tight controls on what it’s used for, and potentially could ensure a greater amount of privacy for people using cloud services such as Gmail. For example, if the email service’s ad-serving software package were obfuscated, it would be impossible for either Google or third parties to do anything other than check email keywords and select which ads were served, Sahai explained.</p>
<p>(Of course, for that particular example to succeed, Sahai said you’d have to be willing to trust that Google programmed the black box to do what they claimed it did.)</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation could be used to plant controls on digital and real-world surveillance technologies. For example, if you’re worried that red light cameras can also double as license plate readers—a controversial technology that the ACLU says may infringe on Americans’ liberties—obfuscated software scanning the images could ensure they would be used only for their apparent purpose—doling out red light tickets.</p>
<p>Another example of its use, also having to do with government accountability, is this: Were the NSA to build an obfuscated black box into a surveillance software packages such as XKeyscore, it could theoretically force agents to use XKeyscore for specific purposes—whether that means preventing XKeyscore searches on American citizens, or whatever other predefined limitations deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Also, inevitably, obfuscation would end up making into the future generations of malicious programs such as malware, remote access trojans, and other hacker tools. While it wouldn’t make malware any tougher to capture, once a researcher does end up getting their hands on it, they will have a much harder time cracking the black box open, Sahai said, and therefore may make it harder to build defenses against.</p>
<p>Those are only a few possibilities of the uses for obfuscation that I discussed with the security researchers I interviewed for this report. There are numerous others including email encryption (by handing over a black box to a friend that can decrypt messages), shorter and more efficient digital signatures—used to sign software patches, for example, which sounds simple but is actually tough and important—as well as solve dozens of what cryptographers call open problems.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges ahead, Sahai pointed out that when RSA’s first encryption schemes came out in the 1970s they were totally impractical as well. Today, they’re seamlessly integrated into machines. Peterson said that while the concept still needs to be proven, the potential is intriguing.</p>
<p>“It’s worth approaching with a healthy sense of skepticism,” Peterson said. “But as far as I can tell cryptographers are excited about its possibilities.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>On the internet nobody knows you’re a dog. Unless you tell them you are. Or that you’re a vampire. Or a werewolf. Or a 90s-era professional wrestler.</h3>
<p>The fake social media profile is an old joke, but lately it’s evolving. Maintaining a fictional online identity has become a lifestyle, a social pursuit, an act of collaborative fiction. The role-playing universe has migrated from the fringes of the internet to that blandest of social networks, Facebook, where it ticks along in parallel to reality. And as role-playing edges closer to the mainstream, it raises questions about just how ‘real’ any of us are in our everyday online lives.</p>
<p>This month has been an interesting one for issues of internet identity. Most recently, Google Plus retired their ban on fake profiles after three years of steady refusal (this would be a landmark in online privacy, were anyone still using Google Plus). Joanie Faircloth, a woman who used Tumblr posts and XOJane comments to accuse musician Conor Oberst of rape, retracted her accusations after months of campaigning against him, admitting she made the story up. And Gilberto Valle, the ‘Cannibal Cop,’ was released after his conviction for plotting to murder and eat several women online was overturned. Consulting messages gleaned from Valle’s profiles on fetish websites, the judge dismissed his plans as nothing more than fantasy role-play.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Facebook has become host to countless role-playing communities, with one for every conceivable fandom.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of whether something online is ‘real’ or not remains blurry. Somewhere between the Instagrammed cupcakes that no one actually eats, the dubious viral children and the tiger tamers on Tinder, we smudged the line between fact and fiction. Social media thrives on self-delusion: even Facebook, for all its regime of innocuous Likes, encourages us to present only the positives in life: the sunsets, the restaurant meals, the group-hangs at the beach. The issue is that we all lie online: anyone who’s tried online dating knows that.</p>
<p>Now, we find ourselves at a curious cultural moment: that of fantasy games going mainstream. Facebook has become host to countless role-playing communities, with one for every conceivable fandom.</p>
<p><iframe class="align-none" src="https://maps.google.com/maps?layer=c&amp;panoid=Qp0yyM3Uc1AAAAQXInc_DA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;source=embed&amp;output=svembed&amp;cbp=13%2C137.44798638050082%2C%2C0%2C21.35357976459683" width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>The role-playing game dates back to the 1970s, but social media has allowed these collaborative fan fictions to rapidly evolve and cater to tiny niches. What differentiates Facebook games from their predecessors is the players’ readiness to blend their own persona with fiction. Facebook is notoriously strict about fake names, even asking users to rat out friends who use them, and this doesn’t sit well with role-players. Even now there is a split between those who play as themselves and those who chance it using pseudonyms, with fake profiles clustering around controversial RPs like ‘Mental Asylum,’ ‘Slave Market,’ and anything involving wolves (‘wolfplay’ communities appear to be a literal bête noire of the role-playing world, with their lexicon of ‘wolfspeak’ coming in for targeted, often hilarious, criticism).</p>
<p>But by and large, players are content to combine role-play with their personal profiles. The consensus is that most of these players are very young, likely in their early teens. As a generation who learned to write fanfic before they learned to tweet, it makes sense that they view Facebook as a creative outlet. The games they engage in—everything from werewolf conventions to Sherlock-themed mafia wars—serve as an outlet for the bitching, the drama, and the Machiavellian self-advancement which might otherwise turn into cyberbullying.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18" style="max-width: 724px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1405635290409778.png"><img class="wp-image-18 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1405635290409778.png" alt="1405635290409778" width="724" height="549" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Sherlock Mafia RP Facebook page</figcaption></figure>
<p>They have grown up with a very different concept of ‘me IRL’: any online setting is fair game for self-fashioning. Fantasy role-play, the ultimate anti-selfie, helps to ease players into real life. It serves as training for the day when they role-play as themselves.</p>
<p>The time and care the average player puts into building up their character could put a 90s Tamagotchi owner to shame. Reputations and relationships are slowly forged through one-on-one chats supplementing bigger events on the group page. Finding a partner is crucial, and those who can’t must resort to trawling singles pages.</p>
<p>Role-playing is thought of as one of the more female-friendly parts of the gaming world, one where the male gaze and gender roles can be subverted (one where, for example, Sherlock can be impregnated with Watson’s baby). There is something benign about role-play games: thematically they range from the inane (K-pop groups and shows like Glee and Pretty Little Liars) to the baffling and forlorn (the ‘Roleplay Prom,’ anyone?). They lean towards camp, dwelling on old TV shows, rewriting unsatisfactory endings and keeping long-forgotten fandoms alive.</p>
<p>At times it feels as though role-players hide behind their dense web of abbreviations for protection from a skeptical public. There’s a lack of coherence across role-play communities, with no two identical explanations of how the games actually work. To make up for its conflicts, this unruly world polices itself: each page specifies an age limit and their own grammatical etiquette.</p>
<p>To join the social network but then act out of character confounds the patterns Facebook aims to record.<br />
Formatting and spelling are valued, as are the word counts which ‘literate’ role-playing communities enforce (“Your starters and replies MUST be at least five sentences long” states the group “Literate Roleplay!☆彡”). Posts are gently overwritten in that very internet way: players include accents, vocal tics, even animal noises. The fourth wall is occasionally broken with messages enclosed in brackets, politely asking for permission to take part.</p>
<p>Role-players disapprove of ‘god modding,’ when a player writes an invincible character who is boringly immune to attacks. Another common complaint is failure to finish games: players drop off, life gets in the way, and communities diminish. As with blogs where the author apologizes for being ‘so busy’ only to disappear several posts later, Facebook is littered with communities which have streamed off into nothingness, sounding boards full of unheard ‘prompts’ and bitter announcements that the page owner is thinking of giving up.</p>
<p>Roleplay Gateway, a site which claims to be 50,000 strong, features a chart of its most popular role-plays. Those which thrive consistently are not always predictable: Harry Potter plots do well, as do Skyrim and Hunger Games role-plays, and various factions of vampires and werewolves from Twilight. One of the more surprising themes is WWE wrestling, a hyperbolic world unto itself which is detailed in this Reddit post (expect multiple marriages to WWE Divas, family feuds, and a prison term for a man named ‘Nitro’).</p>
<p>For all its eccentricity, role-playing appears to come naturally to those who do it. And yet it goes against everything Facebook wants of us—a service that even manages to harvest shadow profiles on people that haven’t signed up. To join the social network but then act out of character confounds the patterns Facebook aims to record. In a small way it disrupts the slow, pernicious blandness that social media encourages, letting our alter egos spill out messily around the edges.</p>
<p>It gives rise to a new age of consensual catfishing, one in which we are finally at ease with the fact that our online presence has always been a little bit fake.</p>
