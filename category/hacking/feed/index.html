<p style="color:#313131;font-size:24px" class="has-drop-cap">Early on a Saturday morning 60 years ago, the millennia-old dream of spaceflight came true as Sputnik 1 rocketed into orbit to become Earth&#x27;s first human-made satellite. The mission notoriously shocked the world and minted a new era of human exploration, but what&#x27;s less well-known is that Sputnik arose, in part, from a 19th century dream to raise the dead. Really.</p>



<p style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee" class="has-background">On this day in 1957, the 184-pound spacecraft departed from a modest Kazakh launchpad that would later evolve into the famous Baikonur Cosmodrome, currently the only spaceport on Earth capable of transporting humans to the International Space Station (ISS). The local time of liftoff was 1:28 AM on October 5, but for people living in North American, European, and Western Russian time zones, the launch occurred on Friday, October 4, and history has memorialized that date as Sputnik&#x27;s anniversary.</p>



<p>Sputnik triggered the Space Race, a geopolitically intense and technologically productive phase of the Cold War, which climaxed with NASA&#x27;s six Apollo Moon landings from 1969 to 1972. The Sputnik crisis, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html">a period of Western anxiety</a>about the clear Soviet lead in spaceflight—and its reconnaissance and military implications—jumpstarted American defense, science, and education initiatives that profoundly impacted the course of world events over the subsequent six decades.</p>

<p>This explains why the satellite&#x27;s flight is usually framed as the starting shot of a new era, syncing up with the &quot;space race&quot; metaphor. Sputnik is remembered for the world it made, not the world that made it. But the run-up to this mission is as fascinating as its fallout, and weaves together the stories of visionary thinkers against the tumultuous backdrop of imperial Russia&#x27;s transition into the communist USSR.</p>

It began with the futurist philosopher Nikolai Fyodorov (often anglicized as &quot;Fedorov&quot;), who was born in 1829 in the Tambov province of imperial Russia.</p>



<p>Fyodorov believed that humanity needed to be liberated from death to achieve perfection, a view shaped by his Russian Orthodox Christian faith, especially its resurrection stories. Like other transhumanists who have envisioned immortality, Fyodorov speculated about ways to extend lifespans indefinitely, but he also took the premise a lot farther.</p>



<p>It wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent the death of every living person. Every dead person also had to be brought back to life so they could rejoin their descendents in a utopian future. He called this mission humanity&#x27;s &quot;common task.&quot;</p>



<p>In other words, Fyodorov believed that &quot;humanity&#x27;s moral task was to emulate Christ and make bodily resurrection possible,&quot; writes Asif Siddiqi, a space historian based at Fordham University, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rockets-Glare-Spaceflight-Imagination/dp/1107639328">in his book</a> <em>The Red Rockets&#x27; Glare.</em> &quot;Mass resurrection would finally eliminate the artificial boundaries among the &#x27;brotherhood&#x27; of humanity, that is, between the previous and current generations.&quot;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="font-size:23px" class="has-drop-cap">Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, in which the state of Wisconsin will argue that congressional redistricting practices are <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/if_anthony_kennedy_follows_precedent_he_ll_strike_down_partisan_gerrymandering.html">not subject to judicial oversight</a>. At the core of this hearing is whether partisan gerrymandering—a tactic used by political parties to redraw congressional voting districts so that the voting power within those districts is weighted toward their own party—was used to steal the 2012 state elections in Wisconsin from Democrats. The ramifications of this decision will be felt by the entire country.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>The Supreme Court will be deciding whether or not federal courts have the ability to throw out district maps for being too partisan, which requires the justices to be able to articulate just what constitutes partisan gerrymandering in the first place. The practice of gerrymandering has been a thorn in the side of American democracy for most of our nation&#x27;s existence, but continues largely unabated due to the difficulty of defining the point at which a new congressional district can considered to be the result of partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>Various solutions to America&#x27;s gerrymandering problem have been proposed over the years, but most of these have failed to gain traction. In September, however, a team of data scientists at the University of Illinois published a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10589-017-9936-3">paper</a>to little fanfare that offered a novel solution to America&#x27;s gerrymandering woes: Let an algorithm draw the maps.</p>



<p>Although the Illinois researchers, led by computer science professor Sheldon Jacobson, aren&#x27;t the first to propose using artificial intelligence as a solution to the redistricting process, they hope their new approach will be more accessible and fair than previous attempts at stopping gerrymandering with computation.</p>



<p>These computer scientists are motivated by the belief that data and algorithms will create transparency in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hidden-hands-in-redistricting-corporations-special-interests">notoriously opaque redistricting process</a> by exposing the inputs and parameters that led to redrawing a district a certain way. With these inputs and parameters exposed, data scientists hope this will hopefully incentivize a more equitable redistricting process. Yet they are also the first to acknowledge that the same algorithms that can create equity in congressional redistricting can also be used to gerrymander with unprecedented efficiency.</p>

<p>&quot;If a group of politicians in a particular state wants to gerrymander the state to favor them, we can incorporate that into our algorithm and come up with districts which will satisfy their political agenda,&quot; Jacobson told me over the phone. &quot;We&#x27;re not political scientists trying to create an agenda. We&#x27;re trying to create a tool of transparency.&quot;</p>



<p>Algorithms are already widely deployed in the service of partisan gerrymandering and are increasingly used as tools to keep gerrymandering in check. Yet for all their pretension to fairness, it&#x27;s far from certain that algorithms are actually creating more equity in the electoral process. This raises a profoundly important question for the future of the American experiment in democracy: If algorithms have been used for the last few decades to fuel gerrymandering, can they also offer a more equitable way forward?</p>



<h2>A Brief History of Gerrymandering</h2>



<p>Every decade, the United States carries out a population census, which among other things, <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/aboutcd.html">determines</a> how many seats in the House of Representatives are allotted to each state. It is then up to the states to draw up congressional districts, each of which elects a representative of that district to the House. The way the boundaries of these districts are decided varies from state to state, but a few elements pertain to <a href="http://redistricting.lls.edu/where-state.php">almost every</a> redistricting decision: all parts of a district must be geographically connected and districts ought to follow boundaries for cities, towns or counties. Beyond these common elements, redistricting requirements and processes can vary significantly from state to state. In most cases, the state legislature controls the redistricting process, which means that the party with control over the legislature has the ability to gerrymander, or redraw congressional districts in the interests of that party.</p>



<p>To get a better idea of how this practice can drastically affect elections, imagine a state that has 50 constituents. Of these constituents, let&#x27;s say 30 vote Democrat and 20 vote Republican, and the state has five seats in the House, like in the drawing on the left below:</p>


<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1507057131533-ele.png" alt=""> Image: Steven Nass/&nbsp;</p>


<p>In an ideal system the five congressional districts would be perfectly divided and the constituents of each district all shared the same political affiliations. In other words, the Democrats would get three congressional districts and the Republicans would get two by making each vertical column its own district. But what if Democrats controlled the redistricting process? By dividing the constituencies horizontally, they could ensure that their constituencies are the majority in each district and win all five seats in House. Alternatively, if the Republicans were in control of the legislature, they could redistrict the state so that it has the convoluted boundaries seen in the figure on the far right. Under this plan, three districts are majority Republican and the party would represent a majority of the state in terms of voting power in the House.</p>



<p>Of course in real life the distribution of voters in a state is not so neat, but the general idea behind gerrymandering—and its consequences—remains the same.</p>



<p>According to David Daley, the editor in chief of <em>Salon</em> and author of <em>Ratfucked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America&#x27;s Democracy</em>, gerrymandering is also a major source of political stasis in the country. Consider the 2016 election, when 400 of 435 House races were scored as &quot;safe&quot; for Democrat and Republican incumbents as a result of gerrymandering. After the election, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016">only 5</a>seats were transferred to the Democrats from Republicans, and only ten incumbents total lost their seats. Not exactly what you&#x27;d expect at a time when the approval rating for Congress is <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx">consistently below 20 percent</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p>&quot;Gerrymandering drains away competitive districts,&quot; Daley told me in an email. &quot;Uncompetitive districts have made the government responsive only to the extremes. They are a key reason why we can&#x27;t get action even on issues where most Americans agree. When we allow partisans to hijack district lines, we give them the power to hijack democracy itself.&quot;</p><cite>&#8211; Gandhi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Historically, gerrymandering has <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/">been disproportionately wielded by GOP candidates</a> to gain influence, but now some establishment Republicans such as Senator John McCain and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are starting to <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/351115-juan-williams-momentum-builds-against-gerrymandering">break ranks</a> over the issue. The main problem is determining a fair way to draw districts and on what grounds districts can be challenged as the illegitimate products of gerrymandering.</p>



<p>A solution adopted by <a href="http://www.azredistricting.org/">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://www.redistricting.wa.gov/">Washington</a>, and<a href="http://aelc.assembly.ca.gov/"> California</a> was to establish standing non-partisan committees to preside over congressional redistricting following the 2010 census. This is a method of addressing gerrymandering that has been adopted in the UK and other commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, but non-partisan committee have been slow to catch on in the United States and aren&#x27;t necessarily as nonpartisan as they seem, according to Daley.</p>



<p>&quot;Independent commissions are only as good as the criteria they are given to draw districts with, and the people who staff them,&quot; Daley said. &quot;Most states fill these commissions with partisans and political appointees. They end up being incumbent protection rackets, or in the case of Arizona, pushing an already secretive process deeper into the shadows.&quot;</p>



<h2>The Algorithmic Turn</h2>



<p style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee" class="has-background">The idea to apply computers to the redistricting process as a way to foster transparency and equity was first considered over half-a-century ago in 1961, and in 1965 an algorithm had been described that offered &quot;simplified bipartisan computer redistricting.&quot;</p>



<p>By the time the 1990 census rolled around, algorithms had become <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439305275855">the norm</a> for legislators and special interest groups hoping to get a leg up during the redistricting process, although fears about the effects of computers on redistricting processes were already being felt in the early 1980s. A 1981 <a href="https://m.csmonitor.com/1981/0427/042749.html">article</a>in the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> captured the spirit of the times, noting that &quot;even those states that have taken the redistricting process either entirely or substantially out of the hands of state lawmakers are hesitant to step aside and let an impersonal, high-speed machine take over.&quot;</p>



<p>The panic, it seems, was short lived. In 1989, <em>The New York Times </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/us/new-age-of-gerrymandering-political-magic-by-computer.html?mcubz=3">reported</a> that &quot;a profusion of new computer technology will make it possible for any political hack to be a political hacker.&quot; The article describes how at least 10 vendors were developing computer programs at the time that could be used by &quot;politicians, their aides, and special interest groups as well as official redistricting commissions&#8230;to produce their own detailed versions of proposed election districts.&quot;</p>



<p>For the last thirty years, an <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crc_Brace.pdf">ever-growing suite of digital redistricting tools</a> have become available to those with the technical knowledge and funds to wield this proprietary software. Although these algorithms were able to generate dozens of sophisticated district maps in a fraction of the time it would&#x27;ve taken a human to draw just one, they did little to actually solve America&#x27;s gerrymandering problem. Instead, these algorithms simply made it easier for politicians to create maps that served the interest of their party.</p>



<p>Are you a politician that needs to create district maps that favor Republicans in Wisconsin? No, problem—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html?mcubz=3">the algorithm&#x27;s got you covered</a>.</p>



<h2>The Algorithms Strike Back</h2>



<p>In 2016, Wendy Cho and her colleagues at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (a different team than the one led by Jacobson) developed a <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/blue_waters_supercomputer_used_to_develop_a_standard_for_partisan_gerrymand">complex algorithm</a> that uses a supercomputer to generate hundreds of millions of possible district configurations in a matter of hours. The tool was designed to test an enticing idea: what if it were possible to generate every possible district map for a given state, and then use this set of all possible maps to judge the level of partisanship on an officially proposed district map? This tool would essentially be able to quantify the fairness of a given map against the set of every possible map. The only problem is that generating a set of all possible maps is, practically speaking, impossible due to the astronomically large number of potential maps.</p>



<p>Yet as Cho and her colleagues discovered, generating all possible maps isn&#x27;t necessary to achieve their intended goal. Rather, their algorithm whittled the number of necessary maps down to a much more manageable number: about 800 million per state. By using these hundreds of millions of maps as a point of comparison, Cho and her colleagues could statistically expose bias in redistricting procedures.</p>



<p>The downside is that these sorts of technologies are too inaccessible and expensive for general public use because it requires a supercomputer to run. Furthermore, Cho&#x27;s algorithm is better deployed after the fact to determine the degree that a given district map is the result of partisan gerrymandering. If algorithms stand any chance of saving America&#x27;s democracy from gerrymandering, the use of the algorithms and the code they use will also have to be accessible to all.</p>



<p>In this regard, the past decade has been something of a renaissance era for <a href="http://bdistricting.com/about.html#other">algorithmic redistricting</a>. Take, for example, <a href="http://bdistricting.com/2010/">Bdistricting</a> or <a href="http://autoredistrict.org/">Auto-Redistrict</a>, two free open source programs that can be used to generate ostensibly fair, unbiased congressional districts without requiring a supercomputer. There are subtle differences between the types of algorithms these programs use to generate district maps, but both are characterized as local search metaheuristics. This is basically a fancy way of saying that the algorithms manipulate tiny elements within a given domain over thousands of iterations until they arrive at an optimal result.</p>



<p>&quot;A computer can&#x27;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do.&quot;</p>



<p>In the case of gerrymandering, the tiny elements being manipulated by local search algorithms are census blocks, the smallest areas of a given state for which census data (such as population size) is available. There are over <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/census_block_tally.html">11 million census blocks</a> in the US, and each state has at least 24,000 census blocks. These algorithms basically switch the positions of these census blocks one at a time according to certain parameters (the census blocks for a given district must be contiguous, for example, or should contain the same population sizes) until an optimal solution has been reached.</p>



<p>The new algorithm released last month by the Jacobson and his colleagues at the University of Illinois improves on these local search algorithms by adding a structural element called a geo-graph. Whereas other redistricting algorithms, such as Bdistricting or Auto-Redistrict start by essentially randomly generating districts and then tweaking them over thousands of iterations, Jacobson&#x27;s algorithm first analyzes the data in census blocks, which might be imagined as spread out on a graph before the computer, and then uses this data to create congressional districts optimized for certain goals.</p>



<p>&quot;Both Bdistricing and Auto-Redistrict appear to be great tools, incorporate a variety of objectives, and can create fair districts,&quot; Jacobson told me in an email. &quot;But geo-graphs make each local search iteration step highly efficient. This means that what may take them hours, we can do in minutes on a laptop.&quot;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that although the algorithms themselves are entirely apolitical—their only goal is to find the optimal solution to a problem given a certain data set and parameters—the process of determining what parameters should be fed to the algorithm is still hopelessly mired in the all too human world of politics.</p>



<p>&quot;Although the criteria for districts is a political issue, creating these districts is not,&quot; Jacobson told me. &quot;A computer can&#x27;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do. Ultimately, this is an algorithmic data problem.&quot;</p>



<h2>Who Programs the Programmers?</h2>



<p>On the surface, it seems that defining parameters that automatically lead to fair districts would be relatively straightforward. Bdistricting, for instance, generated district maps that were &quot;optimized for equal population and compactness only.&quot; The idea here is that these two criteria are free from &quot;partisan power plays&quot; since they&#x27;re based on metrics that have nothing to do with politics. But as the San Francisco-based programmer Chris Fedor labored to show, unbiased districts don&#x27;t necessarily result in <em>fair</em> districts. As Fedor detailed in a <a href="https://medium.com/@raulfoo/in-defense-of-gerrymandering-politics-as-usual-is-better-than-bad-math-92b89b3f0b43">Medium post</a>, algorithmically optimizing district boundaries for compactness (such as Bdistricting) or randomly generating the boundaries actually leads to districts that are <em>more</em> gerrymandered than the boundaries drafted up by politicians.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms can hide as much as they reveal,&quot; Micah Altman, a professor of computer science at MIT, told me in an email. &quot;Technical choices in an algorithm, how one formalizes criteria, and software implementation can have tremendous implications, but are much more difficult for non-experts to review than comparison of maps and their consequences.&quot;</p>



<p>This point is further reinforced in a 2010 <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=djclpp">paper</a> in the <em>Duke Journal of Constitutional Law and Public Policy</em> by Altman and the University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, which analyzed several trends in the application of digital technologies to the redistricting process. In the case of Bdistricting and Auto-Redistrict, these programs belong to a class of algorithms that seek to automate the redistricting process entirely. Yet as the authors of the paper point out, these types of algorithms run up against some fundamental limits. Creating optimally compact, contiguous, and equal-population districts belong to a class of math-problems described as &quot;<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x385b/the-world-is-knapsack-problem-and-were-just-living-in-it">NP-hard</a>,&quot; which basically means that there isn&#x27;t an algorithm that can solve the problem both quickly and correctly in all possible cases.</p>



<p>A way to get around the NP-hardness of redistricting is to approach the problem heuristically, which is a fancy way of saying that a computer can solve the problem, but not necessarily in the most optimal or perfect way. As the Altman and McDonald describe them, these heuristic algorithms are &quot;problem-solving procedures that, while they may yield acceptable results in practice, provide no guarantees of yielding good solutions in general. Specifically, an algorithm is heuristic if it cannot be shown to yield a correct result, or correct within a known error or approximation or having a known probability of correctness.&quot; Every attempt at automated redistricting—including all of the algorithms mentioned above—have relied on heuristics.</p>



<p>As Altman and McDonald acknowledge, the computational limits of the redistricting problem could be addressed if the non-partisan criteria for redistricting was greatly simplified and ranked (for instance, equal populations are more important than compactness, contiguity more important than the rest, etc.). Yet so far, anything close to a standard for measuring fair districts is lacking and this very issue has been at the heart of landmark Supreme Court cases considering gerrymandering.</p>



<p>The <em>Gill v. Whitford</em> case being heard at the Supreme Court Tuesday is a challenge to the 1986 Supreme Court ruling in <em>Davis v. Bandemer</em> that claimed partisan gerrymandering is able to be subjected to judicial oversight, although the court was divided on just what constituted judicial standards in challenges to partisan gerrymandering.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them, but they are only as good as the criteria that govern them.&quot;</p>



<p>As Justice Byron White wrote in his opinion on the <em>Bandemer</em> case, a &quot;group&#x27;s electoral power is not unconstitutionally diminished by the fact that an apportionment scheme makes winning elections more difficult, and a failure of proportional representation alone does not constitute discrimination.&quot; According to White, discrimination in gerrymandering &quot;only occurs when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter&#x27;s or a group of voters&#x27; influence on the political system as a whole.&quot;</p>



<p>The inability of the Supreme Court to decide on standards with which to judge cases challenging partisan gerrymandering was the justification in a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">2004 Supreme Court case</a> in which a plurality of justices ruled that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are not subject to court oversight since no general standards for judicially challenging partisan gerrymandering exist. Yet the Supreme Court ultimately didn&#x27;t overturn the ruling from the 1986 <em>Bandemer </em>case that determined partisan gerrymandering <em>is</em> subject to judicial oversight since such <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">standards may emerge in the future</a>.</p>



<p>Automated redistricting algorithms basically face the same problem articulated by the Supreme Court ruling in 2004—there continues to be no way to measure at what point a district has been &quot;gerrymandered,&quot; and there are no hard rules for what a &quot;fair district&quot; is. (Although there are protections against <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/">gerrymandering on racial grounds</a>). Merely creating districts randomly or optimized for unbiased parameters (such as compactness or equal-population) is no guarantee that those districts are fair. In absence of simple standards that would make automated redistricting truly feasible, Altman and McDonald suggest another approach to the redistricting problem: using algorithms to foster transparency.</p>



<h2>Bridging the Analog/Digital Divide</h2>



<p>Following the establishment of standing nonpartisan redistricting commissions, Arizona, Washington, and California are now the only three states that are required to solicit public input on redistricting decisions. In these cases, a lightweight machine learning algorithm like the one developed by Jacobson and his colleagues could become an invaluable resource that allows <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0120_redistricting_report.pdf">voters to make informed decisions</a> about the redistricting plans. Even in states where the redistricting process is entirely in the hands of legislators, algorithmic tools would empower the public to keep their legislators in check by exposing the assumptions that went into the creation of congressional districts.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them,&quot; Daley said. &quot;But like independent commissions, they are only as good as the criteria that govern them. The meaningful structural reform that we need involves the way we think about voting and districting itself.&quot;</p>



<p>Still, the combination of algorithms and independent redistricting commissions may offer a way forward, according to Altman and McDonald. As they argued in an <a href="http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-independent-commissions-could-use-internet-and-open-software-maximize-transparency-and">article</a> for <em>Scholars Strategy Network</em>, the internet, coupled with sophisticated and accessible redistricting software, can allow for mass participation in the redistricting process. If this public participation is facilitated by a truly independent commission, which makes all the data, plans and analyses transparent and the tools used to arrive at districts available to the public so that they can compare and comment on these plans, it may be possible to finally create equitable districts.</p>



<p>The plan sounds utopian, but Altman and McDonald have put their principles to work. In 2010, they released an open source software called <a href="http://www.districtbuilder.org/">districtbuilder</a> that enabled broad public participation in the redistricting process by allowing anyone to create, edit, and analyze district plans in a collaborative online environment. While this may sound like it would be reserved for computer nerds with technical know-how, Altman told me it was so simple that they were able to teach elementary school children how to create legal district plans with the tool.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithmic redistricting, along with software that enables the public to participate in examining, evaluating and contributing to plans, when implemented thoughtfully and transparently, can be useful as a method of assisting human to argue for and to implement their representational goals,&quot; Altman said. &quot;However, most proposed algorithmic solutions, such as maximizing some basic notions of geographic compactness, at best embed a set of arbitrary and poorly understood biases into the system, and at worst are cover for attempts to implement political outcomes by proxy.&quot;</p>



<p>At the core of the anti-gerrymandering crusade is the notion that a constituency should be represented in accordance with their beliefs, instead of being subjected to the whims of politicians vying to entrench their party&#x27;s power. That our elected representatives are beholden to their constituencies, and not vice versa, is a fundamental tenet of our democracy.</p>



<p>Algorithms are not a silver bullet for our nation&#x27;s gerrymandering problem, but as Altman has labored to show, they can be effectively incorporated into the political apparatus to make the process of redistricting more transparent and fair. But algorithms can only do so much, and their biggest limitation right now is a lack of quantifiable criteria for what constitutes fair districts. Determining these criteria is a totally political issue, and as much as we might wish for an automated solution, no amount of computing power will ever crack that problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>For all of Bitcoin’s fabled transparency, a key piece of this bubblicious puzzle remains elusively opaque. Who the hell is Satoshi Nakamoto?</h3>
<p>Like a frustrating episode of Lost, there’s one too many clues and few if any answers. Satoshi, of course, is the one who started it all, unleashing his concept of a cryptographic, self-regulating digital currency to the world in his now infamous whitepaper in 2008.</p>
<p>Three years later, he was gone.</p>
<p>Today, Bitcoin is a billion dollar idea being adopted across the globe, and yet little is known about its enigmatic creator. The result has been wild speculation. Ted Nelson, the American pioneer of information technology who coined the term “hypertext,” <a href="http://qz.com/86255/the-mysterious-creator-of-bitcoin-could-be-japanese-mathematician-shinichi-mochizuki-says-the-inventor-of-hypertext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week proposed</a> that Satoshi was a well-known, reclusive Japanese mathematician. <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Yorker</a></em> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1785445/bitcoin-crypto-currency-mystery-reopened" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em></a> have conducted their own investigations. Various theories <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5951.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulate on the web</a>.</p>
<p>Given Satoshi’s paranoid preservation of his privacy, there are no conclusions, only educated guesses. But who doesn’t love a good conspiracy theory, especially when the topic is a disruptive technology that many believe has the potential to truly shakregistere things up?</p>
<h3>WHAT WE KNOW</h3>
<p>Satoshi appeared seemingly out of nowhere in 2008 when he <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a research paper</a> on the <a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptography Mailing List</a>, which laid the foundation for the Bitcoin protocol. He claimed to have been working on the idea for about two years, which, given the robustness of what was produced, implied an exhaustive amount of effort dedicated toward his work.</p>
<p>In January of 2009, he started mining, creating what is known as the “<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">genesis block</a>.” Bitcoin v0.1 was released six days later. By year-end, over 32,000 blocks had been added to this original block, producing a total of 1,624,250 bitcoins. Since all transactions are public on the blockchain, we know that only a quarter of those bitcoins have ever changed hands, leading some to speculate that Satoshi could be sitting on a stash of roughly one million bitcoins, worth ~$120 million at today’s exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the early days, Satoshi was active on the Bitcoin Forum and regularly responded to emails. Though Bitcoin is an open source project, most modifications to the source code were made by Satoshi himself in the first year, but his activity soon began to peter out.</p>
<p>His final programming contribution was made in mid-2010, after he had passed on the reins to Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s current lead developer. In April of 2011, when asked of his dwindling activity, Satoshi explained to one Bitcoin developer that he had “moved on to other things.” At some point, he stopped replying to emails altogether, including those of Andresen. The creator had disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161" style="max-width: 526px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-161" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/7deda737ec724e8499b5dc273024082f.jpg" alt="An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto" width="526" height="419" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">An internet representation of Satoshi Nakamoto</figcaption></figure>
<p>The name Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to be a pseudonym for a person, a group, or even a larger, possibly governmental organization. In Japanese, Satoshi means “clear-thinking” or “wise.” Naka can mean “inside” or “relationship” and moto is used to describe “the origin” or “the foundation.” Put it all together and you get “thinking clearly inside the foundation.” There’s scant evidence that Nakamoto existed outside the context of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>According to his P2P foundation account details, Satoshi claimed to be a 37-year-old male living in Japan. His language of choice was English, but he would alternate between British and American spellings and colloquialisms, which could mean that he was trying to mask his nationality or that Satoshi is actually more than one person. He would post on the forums and respond to emails at random times with no discernible patterns that might indicate a primary time zone.</p>
<p>Based on his limited body of work, we know that Satoshi is highly intelligent and economically competent. He’s a brilliant mathematician, well-versed in cryptography, and a capable programmer, though his code indicates that he most likely wasn’t a professional.</p>
<p>While theoretically sound, his style belied his experience (or lack thereof), leading some, including Andresen, to believe that Satoshi is an academic. A prominent fear in the early days was that some exploitable flaw in the Bitcoin system would eventually surface, undermining the movement. Four years later, the protocol remains bulletproof, a testament to Satoshi’s genius, foresight, and thoroughness. It also suggests that, if he really is a single entity, Satoshi is a hell of a proofreader.</p>
<p>Though it appeared that Satoshi understood that the Bitcoin movement might attract its fair share of ideologues, such as anti-government libertarians, it’s unclear whether or not Satoshi was politically motivated himself. If at times he seemed eager to recruit such groups to the cause, his intent could be interpreted as pragmatic. Keenly aware of the potential social implications of his idea, he left the politicizing to others.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,” he wrote. “I&#8217;m better with code than with words though.” We know, based on his writings, that he had qualms with the banking system and saw Bitcoin as a technological solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that&#8217;s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.</p>
<p>A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. Its time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>THE PRIME SUSPECTS</h3>
<p>Analysis of Satoshi’s coding and writing style have been inconclusive. But with the facts available, a few prominent suspects have emerged, some more widely accepted than others.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Andresen</strong>: As the Bitcoin project’s lead developer, he is an obvious choice (though perhaps too obvious by Satoshi’s standards). Andresen serves as chief scientist on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and equivalent of the Linux’s Linus Torvalds. Outside of Satoshi, Andresen has the most influence on Bitcoin’s direction. The mild-mannered programmer’s technical savvy and work ethic is universally admired within the community.</p>
<p>He has sometimes been referred to as Bitcoin’s “Batman” for his altruism and the nature of his often unrewarding role. One Bitcoin developer who has frequently corresponded with Andresen but wished to remain anonymous, claims conversational similarities between the two, though this has been disputed. Could Satoshi be hiding in plain sight?</p>
<p>Andresen denied being Satoshi when we broached the question over the weekend at the 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose, saying he has a different coding style than Satoshi does.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Clear, Donal O’Mahony, Hitesh Tewari and Michael Peirce of Trinity College, Dublin</strong>: An investigation by Joshua Davis of the New Yorker ultimately led to Michael Clear, a then 23-year-old graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College. Despite his age, Clear appeared to check enough boxes to fit the bill. Named Trinity’s top computer science student in 2008, Clear had co-authored a paper on peer-to-peer cryptography. He was also British. Davis tracked Clear down at the Crytpo 2011 conference in Santa Barbara where Clear denied the allegations. “I&#8217;m not Satoshi,” he said. “But even if I was I wouldn&#8217;t tell you.” (That refrain is common in the Satoshi search.)</p>
<p>Davis’s report prompted further digging among the community, which led to Donal O’Mahony, a professor at the university; Hitesh Tewari, a research assistant; and Michael Peirce, a student, because of various published materials connecting the four including this paper and this book. Along with Clear, the group has been called the Crypto Mano Group (mano is Irish for coin) or CMG. Perhaps coincidentally, none have publicly discussed Bitcoin in spite of their relevant body of work.</p>
<p><strong>Neal J. King, Charles Bry, and Vladamir Oksman</strong>: The New Yorker piece prompted Adam L. Penenberg of Fast Company to conduct his own search for Bitcoin’s mysterious creator. A textual analysis of Satoshi’s whitepaper led Penenberg to a patent application, which shared the term &#8220;computationally impractical to reverse.&#8221; To Penenberg’s surprise, the patent had been filed just three days before the domain Bitcoin.org was registered.</p>
<p>All three have filed patent applications that have to do with encryption, communication, networks, and nodes. All three have also denied being Satoshi, with King going as far as shooting down the concept. “It’s not a very good idea,” King told Penenberg. “Nakamoto’s algorithm is a solution in search of a problem.”</p>
<p>King has been consistent with his skepticism. His latest comment at the Economist continues his argument as to why Bitcoin won’t work: “It never makes contact with the physical world, except through the concepts of credulous dreamers that have not quite woken up.” Knowing Satoshi, however, it could be a ploy to cover his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong>: McCaleb’s name is often brought up during discussions of Satoshi’s identity. The UC Berkeley dropout co-founded Mt. Gox, which is based in Tokyo—a questionable decision given Japan’s high corporate tax rate and regulatory red tape. This has led some to cite this as evidence of a tenuous affinity for the country without McCaleb actually being Japanese. McCaleb also founded eDonkey in 2000, one of the largest (and technically revered) peer-to-peer file-sharing networks at the time.</p>
<p>He would later sell the highly profitable Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, saying that while the service was “cool and needed to exist,” it was no longer “technically interesting.” Once an enthusiastic Bitcoin supporter, McCaleb had also become disillusioned by the protocol’s system of mining “because it wastes so much energy.” He would go on to develop Ripple, what he believes to be an improved iteration of the Bitcoin concept that addresses some of these flaws. Could this have been what Satoshi meant when he said he had “moved on”?</p>
<p><strong>Shinichi Mochizuki</strong>: A recent feature on the Japanese mathematician has prompted Nelson, among others, to speculate that the eccentric genius had, while solving the famed ABC Conjecture, one of math world’s most complex problems, created Bitcoin in his spare time. It’s tough to question Mochizuki’s abilities and the patterns seem to fit.</p>
<p>Like Satoshi, Mochizuki released his ABC Conjecture proof on the internet (instead of established academic channels) and simply walked away, refusing to explain his potentially historic work to the great frustration of mathematicians everywhere. Mochizuki is also a native English speaker, though it’s unclear if he can code or is knowledgeable in cryptography. But given Mochizuki’s mathematics acumen and incredible smarts, it’s not impossible to believe he taught himself along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong>: A conspiracy theorist’s wet dream, another idea that gets tossed around is that Bitcoin is the product of some government or governmental agency. From that vantage point, resources are no longer an issue. But why? The answer is more of an intellectual exercise than actual theory.</p>
<p>Bitcoin could be used as a weapon against the US dollar. It could be used to fund black ops, sort of like a currency version of onion routing, which was first developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. It could be used to strategically trim the overweight financial sector.</p>
<p>If governments believed a widely used digital currency was inevitable, Bitcoin could be a preemptive strike against a potentially malevolent iteration. From the US perspective, it could have been created as a hedge against the waning international power of the dollar, though given the Fed’s policies of quantitative easing, this seems unlikely. The same could be said about the EU and the flailing euro. Along these lines, some have pointed to EU directives on digital currencies that were implemented and voted for well before Bitcoin became widely known as a possible clue.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scariest theory of all is that Bitcoin is actually an Orwellian vehicle that would allow governments to monitor all financial transactions. Bitcoin is often touted for its anonymity, but the transparent nature of the blockchain means every transaction is potentially traceable. Even if each transaction is only associated with a key, armed with enough information, certain organizations would eventually be able to connect the dots. In theory, anyway. In reality, government involvement isn&#8217;t likely, though by no means an impossibility.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE DON’T KNOW</h3>
<p>In the end, we’re right back where we started: a few theories, some circumstantial evidence, and nothing remotely conclusive. It takes only brief examination of his essentially perfect execution of the Bitcoin protocol to realize that Satoshi Nakamoto would treat his quest for privacy with the same level of comprehension. He is a master of the long game.</p>
<p>And no wonder. The creators of e-gold were charged with &#8220;conspiracy to engage in money laundering&#8221; and the &#8220;operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business&#8221; in July of 2008, just months before Satoshi unveiled Bitcoin. Given the treatment of guys like Julian Assange and Kim Dotcom, there’s little upside to being an internet hero when your platform has the potential to disrupt governments and big business.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the possibility that Satoshi could make a comeback at some point. Some within the community assume he is keeping an eye on things, but could re-emerge, if necessary, to right the ship.</p>
<p>“He could kind of step in and say, ‘This is bad.’ It could happen,” a Bitcoin developer told me. “And he would absolutely have enough sway. His word is pretty much bond, especially if he were to come out from reclusiveness after all those years.”</p>
<p>Satoshi could then verify it was him by signing a message to one of his keys from his genesis block. Until then, it’s clear he’s quite content keeping his identity a secret.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The biggest lie about the future is that it&#8217;s going to look much different from today.</h3>
<p>I mean, <em>The Jetsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em> are one thing, but in near-future portrayals—those shown in goofball blockbusters like <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>Minority Report</em>—the world is given a glossy, high-tech makeover. These futuristic landscapes suggest we&#8217;re about to see a bevy of unfathomably large infrastructure investments that will reshape our cities in the next couple decades.</p>
<p>Now take a look outside at your nearest bombed-out road or crumbling bridge. Yeah, your metropolis isn&#8217;t going to be turning into Emerald City any time soon.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s actually going to happen is already happening now: The future will appear, not in leaps and bounds, but on a moving sidewalk, gliding onward just smoothly enough that it doesn&#8217;t shake you into recognition. It&#8217;s still going to take decades for California to complete its futuristic high-speed rail line, for example; when it arrives, it&#8217;s still going to look like a train.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about environmental aesthetics for the past few days, which corresponds with how long I&#8217;ve had Fernando Barbella&#8217;s <a title="Signs from the near future Tumblr" href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signs from the Near Future</a> open on a browser tab. The Barcelona-based creative director started a Tumblr to investigate how the new technologies we dream of will actually begin to subvert our surroundings—which, in our litigious world, mainly means a planet filled with futuristic warning signs.</p>

<p>&#8220;New materials, mashups between living organisms and nanotechnologies, improved capabilities for formerly &#8216;dumb&#8217; and inanimate things&#8230; There a lot of things going on around us!&#8221; Barbella wrote me in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all these advances can be as exciting as disturbing in a way, at the same time, if we think about it,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The fact is all these things are going to cease being just &#8216;projects&#8217; to became part of our reality at some point soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been conditioned to think of the Future, capital F, as something that&#8217;s going to arrive with a bang. But of course that&#8217;s not true. Pithy sentiments like &#8220;every new day is the future&#8221; or whatever, the future is ever-arriving and always evolving. No one is going to flip a switch and suddenly fill our streets with hovercars. (That&#8217;d be rad though!) But one day you&#8217;re going to see an autonomous taxi for the first time and say, &#8220;No shit, those are here now? Cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going for that point: many years ago, when we were kids, the visions for the future were at least disconnected from reality: flying cars, strange architecture buildings surrounding us, among other out of its time things,&#8221; Barbella said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_63" style="max-width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5facwSP3S1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-63 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5facwSP3S1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg" alt="&quot;15% off on synthetic burguers!&quot;." width="1280" height="867" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;15% off on synthetic burguers!&#8221;. Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;The real thing is that [the] future is always part of the present times, in a way, and that&#8217;s why I focused on this approach to a near future where we see these technologies coexisting with us in the most ordinary of environments and places,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Our difficulty in seeing progress as discrete events makes it harder for us to institute checks and balances along the way. It&#8217;s not such an issue for a consumer-facing product like Google Glass; Glass appeared, we all marveled—or scoffed—and now we&#8217;re figuring out new social norms as we go along.</p>
<p>But considering future manifestations of power, such perpetual change is harder to grasp. Take full-body scanners at the airport, or location-based <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/blog/maybe-the-most-orwellian-text-message-ever-sent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government text messages aimed at protestors</a>. Both are very futuristic, concerning things in the abstract, but when actually faced with either, the common response is something more like, &#8220;Wait, they can do this now?&#8221;</p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t accept the future as an endless slog forward, it becomes a lot harder to draw a line in the sand—largely because we&#8217;re still waiting for that line to arrive. And as we wait for that line—and for the courts to rule on cases regarding technology that&#8217;s already out of date—the framework for the future is constantly being laid around us.</p>
<figure id="attachment_65" style="max-width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg"><img class="wp-image-65 size-full" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280.jpg" alt="tumblr_n5fadp1iYl1tbaq2ro1_1280" width="1280" height="878" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image: <a href="http://signsfromthenearfuture.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Signs From The Near Future</a>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;We will probably never know how worried the people at the top are about the democratization of new technologies, and all the doors and windows and new paths these things are opening for regular Joes like us,&#8221; Barbella said. &#8220;So we can clearly imagine this near future full of warnings and signs telling us how—or when—to use or not to use these technologies originally designed to improve our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbella said that as the project continues, he hopes to cross it over into the physical world, either with a book or a show, or perhaps by producing signs for real and &#8220;start doing some urban interventions.&#8221; He also said that, despite his project standing as a reminder that we need to wake up with regards to our progress, he maintains a positive outlook on the world to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole responsibility is on us. Not the governments, not the monstrous corporations. They just care about themselves, about being reelected or the bonus they will see at the end of the year,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should always be aware that while we waste time on social media, or going after the latest techno toy, there are people who may need our help, and perhaps we can use both the existing and emerging technologies to do it.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine trying to throw a dart at a bullseye that’s 200 feet away with only your bare hands. Now, add a blindfold to the equation. Theoretically, it might be possible. But practically, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible—about the same odds as trying to break a new form of software protection called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation—similar in nature to a technology IBM has patented called homomorphic encryption—is one of the possible futures of cryptography. The main idea behind it is relatively straightforward: through some arcane math, a team of six cryptography experts have figured out that it’s possible to mask code, making it nearly impenetrable to hacks, while at the same time still being possible to run as useful software.</p>
<p>“Traditional encryption is about securing data,” said Dr. Dan Boneh, an encryption expert at Stanford. “Obfuscation is about securing software—a very different notion than encryption.”</p>
<p>The obfuscator works like this. A developer would code a piece of software, and then for added security, run it through a typical garbler, as most commercial software is these days. Following that, the developer would run the garbled software through the indistinguishability obfuscator—think of it kind of like an encryption application.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The obfuscator takes a part the garbled code and mixes random elements together in such a way that when the obfuscated program is run in its intended fashion, the randomness is negated, and the intended output is generated. If the program is told to do something other than what its designer intended, it won’t work.</p>
<p>“It means that I will be able to give you the code, but you won’t be able to learn how it’s constructed, or about any thing I wish to keep a secret within it,” Boneh said.</p>
<p>Today most closed source code is obfuscated to some degree—not directly accessible to prying eyes. But, such code is nearly always hackable given enough resources, cryptography expert Dr. Zachary Peterson told me over the phone. And online, most code is openly embedded in web pages, and can be easily studied. That’s why being able to use indistinguishability obfuscation to create “black box” software is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Dr. Amit Sahai—one of the researchers who made the breakthrough, and who has been working on the obfuscation for 17 years—took pains to explain that despite catchy headlines, the claim obfuscation would make software “unhackable” isn’t accurate. The reality is that it still would be possible to crack—just that with current technology it would be damn hard.</p>
<p>“You might get lucky and hit the dart board, it’s just a hell of a lot harder,&#8221; he said. (The dart board thing was my metaphor, but Sahai said it was a good one so we sort of talked around it.)</p>
<p>It’s important to note that right now this new form of software obfuscation is completely impractical to use, Sahai said. It would take weeks, or months to receive a meaningful result from querying an obfuscated program. That’s mostly because of computing power, and the incredibly complex calculations necessary to run obfuscated code.​</p>
<p>“We have the first mathematical approach,” he said, “This isn’t coming in the next couple of years to say the least.”</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UroIzjhTCEY?rel=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Still, having the ability to develop black box software would allow tight controls on what it’s used for, and potentially could ensure a greater amount of privacy for people using cloud services such as Gmail. For example, if the email service’s ad-serving software package were obfuscated, it would be impossible for either Google or third parties to do anything other than check email keywords and select which ads were served, Sahai explained.</p>
<p>(Of course, for that particular example to succeed, Sahai said you’d have to be willing to trust that Google programmed the black box to do what they claimed it did.)</p>
<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation could be used to plant controls on digital and real-world surveillance technologies. For example, if you’re worried that red light cameras can also double as license plate readers—a controversial technology that the ACLU says may infringe on Americans’ liberties—obfuscated software scanning the images could ensure they would be used only for their apparent purpose—doling out red light tickets.</p>
<p>Another example of its use, also having to do with government accountability, is this: Were the NSA to build an obfuscated black box into a surveillance software packages such as XKeyscore, it could theoretically force agents to use XKeyscore for specific purposes—whether that means preventing XKeyscore searches on American citizens, or whatever other predefined limitations deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Also, inevitably, obfuscation would end up making into the future generations of malicious programs such as malware, remote access trojans, and other hacker tools. While it wouldn’t make malware any tougher to capture, once a researcher does end up getting their hands on it, they will have a much harder time cracking the black box open, Sahai said, and therefore may make it harder to build defenses against.</p>
<p>Those are only a few possibilities of the uses for obfuscation that I discussed with the security researchers I interviewed for this report. There are numerous others including email encryption (by handing over a black box to a friend that can decrypt messages), shorter and more efficient digital signatures—used to sign software patches, for example, which sounds simple but is actually tough and important—as well as solve dozens of what cryptographers call open problems.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges ahead, Sahai pointed out that when RSA’s first encryption schemes came out in the 1970s they were totally impractical as well. Today, they’re seamlessly integrated into machines. Peterson said that while the concept still needs to be proven, the potential is intriguing.</p>
<p>“It’s worth approaching with a healthy sense of skepticism,” Peterson said. “But as far as I can tell cryptographers are excited about its possibilities.”</p>
