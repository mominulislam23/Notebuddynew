<p style="font-size:23px" class="has-drop-cap">Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for <em>Gill v. Whitford</em>, in which the state of Wisconsin will argue that congressional redistricting practices are <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/09/if_anthony_kennedy_follows_precedent_he_ll_strike_down_partisan_gerrymandering.html">not subject to judicial oversight</a>. At the core of this hearing is whether partisan gerrymandering—a tactic used by political parties to redraw congressional voting districts so that the voting power within those districts is weighted toward their own party—was used to steal the 2012 state elections in Wisconsin from Democrats. The ramifications of this decision will be felt by the entire country.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>The Supreme Court will be deciding whether or not federal courts have the ability to throw out district maps for being too partisan, which requires the justices to be able to articulate just what constitutes partisan gerrymandering in the first place. The practice of gerrymandering has been a thorn in the side of American democracy for most of our nation&#x27;s existence, but continues largely unabated due to the difficulty of defining the point at which a new congressional district can considered to be the result of partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>Various solutions to America&#x27;s gerrymandering problem have been proposed over the years, but most of these have failed to gain traction. In September, however, a team of data scientists at the University of Illinois published a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10589-017-9936-3">paper</a>to little fanfare that offered a novel solution to America&#x27;s gerrymandering woes: Let an algorithm draw the maps.</p>



<p>Although the Illinois researchers, led by computer science professor Sheldon Jacobson, aren&#x27;t the first to propose using artificial intelligence as a solution to the redistricting process, they hope their new approach will be more accessible and fair than previous attempts at stopping gerrymandering with computation.</p>



<p>These computer scientists are motivated by the belief that data and algorithms will create transparency in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hidden-hands-in-redistricting-corporations-special-interests">notoriously opaque redistricting process</a> by exposing the inputs and parameters that led to redrawing a district a certain way. With these inputs and parameters exposed, data scientists hope this will hopefully incentivize a more equitable redistricting process. Yet they are also the first to acknowledge that the same algorithms that can create equity in congressional redistricting can also be used to gerrymander with unprecedented efficiency.</p>

<p>&quot;If a group of politicians in a particular state wants to gerrymander the state to favor them, we can incorporate that into our algorithm and come up with districts which will satisfy their political agenda,&quot; Jacobson told me over the phone. &quot;We&#x27;re not political scientists trying to create an agenda. We&#x27;re trying to create a tool of transparency.&quot;</p>



<p>Algorithms are already widely deployed in the service of partisan gerrymandering and are increasingly used as tools to keep gerrymandering in check. Yet for all their pretension to fairness, it&#x27;s far from certain that algorithms are actually creating more equity in the electoral process. This raises a profoundly important question for the future of the American experiment in democracy: If algorithms have been used for the last few decades to fuel gerrymandering, can they also offer a more equitable way forward?</p>



<h2>A Brief History of Gerrymandering</h2>



<p>Every decade, the United States carries out a population census, which among other things, <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/aboutcd.html">determines</a> how many seats in the House of Representatives are allotted to each state. It is then up to the states to draw up congressional districts, each of which elects a representative of that district to the House. The way the boundaries of these districts are decided varies from state to state, but a few elements pertain to <a href="http://redistricting.lls.edu/where-state.php">almost every</a> redistricting decision: all parts of a district must be geographically connected and districts ought to follow boundaries for cities, towns or counties. Beyond these common elements, redistricting requirements and processes can vary significantly from state to state. In most cases, the state legislature controls the redistricting process, which means that the party with control over the legislature has the ability to gerrymander, or redraw congressional districts in the interests of that party.</p>



<p>To get a better idea of how this practice can drastically affect elections, imagine a state that has 50 constituents. Of these constituents, let&#x27;s say 30 vote Democrat and 20 vote Republican, and the state has five seats in the House, like in the drawing on the left below:</p>


<p><img src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1507057131533-ele.png" alt=""> Image: Steven Nass/&nbsp;</p>


<p>In an ideal system the five congressional districts would be perfectly divided and the constituents of each district all shared the same political affiliations. In other words, the Democrats would get three congressional districts and the Republicans would get two by making each vertical column its own district. But what if Democrats controlled the redistricting process? By dividing the constituencies horizontally, they could ensure that their constituencies are the majority in each district and win all five seats in House. Alternatively, if the Republicans were in control of the legislature, they could redistrict the state so that it has the convoluted boundaries seen in the figure on the far right. Under this plan, three districts are majority Republican and the party would represent a majority of the state in terms of voting power in the House.</p>



<p>Of course in real life the distribution of voters in a state is not so neat, but the general idea behind gerrymandering—and its consequences—remains the same.</p>



<p>According to David Daley, the editor in chief of <em>Salon</em> and author of <em>Ratfucked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America&#x27;s Democracy</em>, gerrymandering is also a major source of political stasis in the country. Consider the 2016 election, when 400 of 435 House races were scored as &quot;safe&quot; for Democrat and Republican incumbents as a result of gerrymandering. After the election, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2016">only 5</a>seats were transferred to the Democrats from Republicans, and only ten incumbents total lost their seats. Not exactly what you&#x27;d expect at a time when the approval rating for Congress is <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx">consistently below 20 percent</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
    <p>&quot;Gerrymandering drains away competitive districts,&quot; Daley told me in an email. &quot;Uncompetitive districts have made the government responsive only to the extremes. They are a key reason why we can&#x27;t get action even on issues where most Americans agree. When we allow partisans to hijack district lines, we give them the power to hijack democracy itself.&quot;</p><cite>&#8211; Gandhi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Historically, gerrymandering has <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/">been disproportionately wielded by GOP candidates</a> to gain influence, but now some establishment Republicans such as Senator John McCain and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are starting to <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/351115-juan-williams-momentum-builds-against-gerrymandering">break ranks</a> over the issue. The main problem is determining a fair way to draw districts and on what grounds districts can be challenged as the illegitimate products of gerrymandering.</p>



<p>A solution adopted by <a href="http://www.azredistricting.org/">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://www.redistricting.wa.gov/">Washington</a>, and<a href="http://aelc.assembly.ca.gov/"> California</a> was to establish standing non-partisan committees to preside over congressional redistricting following the 2010 census. This is a method of addressing gerrymandering that has been adopted in the UK and other commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, but non-partisan committee have been slow to catch on in the United States and aren&#x27;t necessarily as nonpartisan as they seem, according to Daley.</p>



<p>&quot;Independent commissions are only as good as the criteria they are given to draw districts with, and the people who staff them,&quot; Daley said. &quot;Most states fill these commissions with partisans and political appointees. They end up being incumbent protection rackets, or in the case of Arizona, pushing an already secretive process deeper into the shadows.&quot;</p>



<h2>The Algorithmic Turn</h2>



<p style="background-color:#0693e3;color:#eee" class="has-background">The idea to apply computers to the redistricting process as a way to foster transparency and equity was first considered over half-a-century ago in 1961, and in 1965 an algorithm had been described that offered &quot;simplified bipartisan computer redistricting.&quot;</p>



<p>By the time the 1990 census rolled around, algorithms had become <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439305275855">the norm</a> for legislators and special interest groups hoping to get a leg up during the redistricting process, although fears about the effects of computers on redistricting processes were already being felt in the early 1980s. A 1981 <a href="https://m.csmonitor.com/1981/0427/042749.html">article</a>in the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> captured the spirit of the times, noting that &quot;even those states that have taken the redistricting process either entirely or substantially out of the hands of state lawmakers are hesitant to step aside and let an impersonal, high-speed machine take over.&quot;</p>



<p>The panic, it seems, was short lived. In 1989, <em>The New York Times </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/10/us/new-age-of-gerrymandering-political-magic-by-computer.html?mcubz=3">reported</a> that &quot;a profusion of new computer technology will make it possible for any political hack to be a political hacker.&quot; The article describes how at least 10 vendors were developing computer programs at the time that could be used by &quot;politicians, their aides, and special interest groups as well as official redistricting commissions&#8230;to produce their own detailed versions of proposed election districts.&quot;</p>



<p>For the last thirty years, an <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/crc_Brace.pdf">ever-growing suite of digital redistricting tools</a> have become available to those with the technical knowledge and funds to wield this proprietary software. Although these algorithms were able to generate dozens of sophisticated district maps in a fraction of the time it would&#x27;ve taken a human to draw just one, they did little to actually solve America&#x27;s gerrymandering problem. Instead, these algorithms simply made it easier for politicians to create maps that served the interest of their party.</p>



<p>Are you a politician that needs to create district maps that favor Republicans in Wisconsin? No, problem—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html?mcubz=3">the algorithm&#x27;s got you covered</a>.</p>



<h2>The Algorithms Strike Back</h2>



<p>In 2016, Wendy Cho and her colleagues at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (a different team than the one led by Jacobson) developed a <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/blue_waters_supercomputer_used_to_develop_a_standard_for_partisan_gerrymand">complex algorithm</a> that uses a supercomputer to generate hundreds of millions of possible district configurations in a matter of hours. The tool was designed to test an enticing idea: what if it were possible to generate every possible district map for a given state, and then use this set of all possible maps to judge the level of partisanship on an officially proposed district map? This tool would essentially be able to quantify the fairness of a given map against the set of every possible map. The only problem is that generating a set of all possible maps is, practically speaking, impossible due to the astronomically large number of potential maps.</p>



<p>Yet as Cho and her colleagues discovered, generating all possible maps isn&#x27;t necessary to achieve their intended goal. Rather, their algorithm whittled the number of necessary maps down to a much more manageable number: about 800 million per state. By using these hundreds of millions of maps as a point of comparison, Cho and her colleagues could statistically expose bias in redistricting procedures.</p>



<p>The downside is that these sorts of technologies are too inaccessible and expensive for general public use because it requires a supercomputer to run. Furthermore, Cho&#x27;s algorithm is better deployed after the fact to determine the degree that a given district map is the result of partisan gerrymandering. If algorithms stand any chance of saving America&#x27;s democracy from gerrymandering, the use of the algorithms and the code they use will also have to be accessible to all.</p>



<p>In this regard, the past decade has been something of a renaissance era for <a href="http://bdistricting.com/about.html#other">algorithmic redistricting</a>. Take, for example, <a href="http://bdistricting.com/2010/">Bdistricting</a> or <a href="http://autoredistrict.org/">Auto-Redistrict</a>, two free open source programs that can be used to generate ostensibly fair, unbiased congressional districts without requiring a supercomputer. There are subtle differences between the types of algorithms these programs use to generate district maps, but both are characterized as local search metaheuristics. This is basically a fancy way of saying that the algorithms manipulate tiny elements within a given domain over thousands of iterations until they arrive at an optimal result.</p>



<p>&quot;A computer can&#x27;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do.&quot;</p>



<p>In the case of gerrymandering, the tiny elements being manipulated by local search algorithms are census blocks, the smallest areas of a given state for which census data (such as population size) is available. There are over <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/census_block_tally.html">11 million census blocks</a> in the US, and each state has at least 24,000 census blocks. These algorithms basically switch the positions of these census blocks one at a time according to certain parameters (the census blocks for a given district must be contiguous, for example, or should contain the same population sizes) until an optimal solution has been reached.</p>



<p>The new algorithm released last month by the Jacobson and his colleagues at the University of Illinois improves on these local search algorithms by adding a structural element called a geo-graph. Whereas other redistricting algorithms, such as Bdistricting or Auto-Redistrict start by essentially randomly generating districts and then tweaking them over thousands of iterations, Jacobson&#x27;s algorithm first analyzes the data in census blocks, which might be imagined as spread out on a graph before the computer, and then uses this data to create congressional districts optimized for certain goals.</p>



<p>&quot;Both Bdistricing and Auto-Redistrict appear to be great tools, incorporate a variety of objectives, and can create fair districts,&quot; Jacobson told me in an email. &quot;But geo-graphs make each local search iteration step highly efficient. This means that what may take them hours, we can do in minutes on a laptop.&quot;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that although the algorithms themselves are entirely apolitical—their only goal is to find the optimal solution to a problem given a certain data set and parameters—the process of determining what parameters should be fed to the algorithm is still hopelessly mired in the all too human world of politics.</p>



<p>&quot;Although the criteria for districts is a political issue, creating these districts is not,&quot; Jacobson told me. &quot;A computer can&#x27;t decide the criteria for creating a district, but it can create districts based on these criteria better than any human could do. Ultimately, this is an algorithmic data problem.&quot;</p>



<h2>Who Programs the Programmers?</h2>



<p>On the surface, it seems that defining parameters that automatically lead to fair districts would be relatively straightforward. Bdistricting, for instance, generated district maps that were &quot;optimized for equal population and compactness only.&quot; The idea here is that these two criteria are free from &quot;partisan power plays&quot; since they&#x27;re based on metrics that have nothing to do with politics. But as the San Francisco-based programmer Chris Fedor labored to show, unbiased districts don&#x27;t necessarily result in <em>fair</em> districts. As Fedor detailed in a <a href="https://medium.com/@raulfoo/in-defense-of-gerrymandering-politics-as-usual-is-better-than-bad-math-92b89b3f0b43">Medium post</a>, algorithmically optimizing district boundaries for compactness (such as Bdistricting) or randomly generating the boundaries actually leads to districts that are <em>more</em> gerrymandered than the boundaries drafted up by politicians.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms can hide as much as they reveal,&quot; Micah Altman, a professor of computer science at MIT, told me in an email. &quot;Technical choices in an algorithm, how one formalizes criteria, and software implementation can have tremendous implications, but are much more difficult for non-experts to review than comparison of maps and their consequences.&quot;</p>



<p>This point is further reinforced in a 2010 <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=djclpp">paper</a> in the <em>Duke Journal of Constitutional Law and Public Policy</em> by Altman and the University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald, which analyzed several trends in the application of digital technologies to the redistricting process. In the case of Bdistricting and Auto-Redistrict, these programs belong to a class of algorithms that seek to automate the redistricting process entirely. Yet as the authors of the paper point out, these types of algorithms run up against some fundamental limits. Creating optimally compact, contiguous, and equal-population districts belong to a class of math-problems described as &quot;<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x385b/the-world-is-knapsack-problem-and-were-just-living-in-it">NP-hard</a>,&quot; which basically means that there isn&#x27;t an algorithm that can solve the problem both quickly and correctly in all possible cases.</p>



<p>A way to get around the NP-hardness of redistricting is to approach the problem heuristically, which is a fancy way of saying that a computer can solve the problem, but not necessarily in the most optimal or perfect way. As the Altman and McDonald describe them, these heuristic algorithms are &quot;problem-solving procedures that, while they may yield acceptable results in practice, provide no guarantees of yielding good solutions in general. Specifically, an algorithm is heuristic if it cannot be shown to yield a correct result, or correct within a known error or approximation or having a known probability of correctness.&quot; Every attempt at automated redistricting—including all of the algorithms mentioned above—have relied on heuristics.</p>



<p>As Altman and McDonald acknowledge, the computational limits of the redistricting problem could be addressed if the non-partisan criteria for redistricting was greatly simplified and ranked (for instance, equal populations are more important than compactness, contiguity more important than the rest, etc.). Yet so far, anything close to a standard for measuring fair districts is lacking and this very issue has been at the heart of landmark Supreme Court cases considering gerrymandering.</p>



<p>The <em>Gill v. Whitford</em> case being heard at the Supreme Court Tuesday is a challenge to the 1986 Supreme Court ruling in <em>Davis v. Bandemer</em> that claimed partisan gerrymandering is able to be subjected to judicial oversight, although the court was divided on just what constituted judicial standards in challenges to partisan gerrymandering.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them, but they are only as good as the criteria that govern them.&quot;</p>



<p>As Justice Byron White wrote in his opinion on the <em>Bandemer</em> case, a &quot;group&#x27;s electoral power is not unconstitutionally diminished by the fact that an apportionment scheme makes winning elections more difficult, and a failure of proportional representation alone does not constitute discrimination.&quot; According to White, discrimination in gerrymandering &quot;only occurs when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter&#x27;s or a group of voters&#x27; influence on the political system as a whole.&quot;</p>



<p>The inability of the Supreme Court to decide on standards with which to judge cases challenging partisan gerrymandering was the justification in a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">2004 Supreme Court case</a> in which a plurality of justices ruled that challenges to partisan gerrymandering are not subject to court oversight since no general standards for judicially challenging partisan gerrymandering exist. Yet the Supreme Court ultimately didn&#x27;t overturn the ruling from the 1986 <em>Bandemer </em>case that determined partisan gerrymandering <em>is</em> subject to judicial oversight since such <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-1580.ZC.html">standards may emerge in the future</a>.</p>



<p>Automated redistricting algorithms basically face the same problem articulated by the Supreme Court ruling in 2004—there continues to be no way to measure at what point a district has been &quot;gerrymandered,&quot; and there are no hard rules for what a &quot;fair district&quot; is. (Although there are protections against <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/09/how-a-widespread-practice-to-politically-empower-african-americans-might-actually-harm-them/">gerrymandering on racial grounds</a>). Merely creating districts randomly or optimized for unbiased parameters (such as compactness or equal-population) is no guarantee that those districts are fair. In absence of simple standards that would make automated redistricting truly feasible, Altman and McDonald suggest another approach to the redistricting problem: using algorithms to foster transparency.</p>



<h2>Bridging the Analog/Digital Divide</h2>



<p>Following the establishment of standing nonpartisan redistricting commissions, Arizona, Washington, and California are now the only three states that are required to solicit public input on redistricting decisions. In these cases, a lightweight machine learning algorithm like the one developed by Jacobson and his colleagues could become an invaluable resource that allows <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/0120_redistricting_report.pdf">voters to make informed decisions</a> about the redistricting plans. Even in states where the redistricting process is entirely in the hands of legislators, algorithmic tools would empower the public to keep their legislators in check by exposing the assumptions that went into the creation of congressional districts.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithms are a terrific tool and there could definitely be a role for them,&quot; Daley said. &quot;But like independent commissions, they are only as good as the criteria that govern them. The meaningful structural reform that we need involves the way we think about voting and districting itself.&quot;</p>



<p>Still, the combination of algorithms and independent redistricting commissions may offer a way forward, according to Altman and McDonald. As they argued in an <a href="http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/how-independent-commissions-could-use-internet-and-open-software-maximize-transparency-and">article</a> for <em>Scholars Strategy Network</em>, the internet, coupled with sophisticated and accessible redistricting software, can allow for mass participation in the redistricting process. If this public participation is facilitated by a truly independent commission, which makes all the data, plans and analyses transparent and the tools used to arrive at districts available to the public so that they can compare and comment on these plans, it may be possible to finally create equitable districts.</p>



<p>The plan sounds utopian, but Altman and McDonald have put their principles to work. In 2010, they released an open source software called <a href="http://www.districtbuilder.org/">districtbuilder</a> that enabled broad public participation in the redistricting process by allowing anyone to create, edit, and analyze district plans in a collaborative online environment. While this may sound like it would be reserved for computer nerds with technical know-how, Altman told me it was so simple that they were able to teach elementary school children how to create legal district plans with the tool.</p>



<p>&quot;Algorithmic redistricting, along with software that enables the public to participate in examining, evaluating and contributing to plans, when implemented thoughtfully and transparently, can be useful as a method of assisting human to argue for and to implement their representational goals,&quot; Altman said. &quot;However, most proposed algorithmic solutions, such as maximizing some basic notions of geographic compactness, at best embed a set of arbitrary and poorly understood biases into the system, and at worst are cover for attempts to implement political outcomes by proxy.&quot;</p>



<p>At the core of the anti-gerrymandering crusade is the notion that a constituency should be represented in accordance with their beliefs, instead of being subjected to the whims of politicians vying to entrench their party&#x27;s power. That our elected representatives are beholden to their constituencies, and not vice versa, is a fundamental tenet of our democracy.</p>



<p>Algorithms are not a silver bullet for our nation&#x27;s gerrymandering problem, but as Altman has labored to show, they can be effectively incorporated into the political apparatus to make the process of redistricting more transparent and fair. But algorithms can only do so much, and their biggest limitation right now is a lack of quantifiable criteria for what constitutes fair districts. Determining these criteria is a totally political issue, and as much as we might wish for an automated solution, no amount of computing power will ever crack that problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>5 Years ago, Brian Trautman dropped the mooring lines of his boat Delos, and left the business World in Seattle behind him. He and his crew planned an epic trip across the Pacific Ocean to New Zealand but when they finally got there, they weren’t ready to stop…Asia was beckoning.</p>
<p>Asia at Sea talked to Brian about how this all started and to find out where they are now and how they are getting along.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Tell us about the boat. When and where did you buy her? Did you name her yourself? And if so what does the name mean?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I remember the first time I walked down the dock and saw Delos sitting there. She just screamed out “Take me across an ocean!” . I was living and working in Seattle at the time and had been shopping for a solid, blue water cruising boat for over a year. I went to a bunch of boat shows drooling over everything then heard about the Amel boats from a cruising seminar. At that time there was only one Amel Super Maramu for sale on the West coast of the US. It just happened to be in Bellingham, a few hours drive north of Seattle almost on the Canadian border so I headed up to take a look. They say that when you find your boat you know it, and that’s exactly what it was like. I put in an offer and the sale closed a few months later in June of 2008.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>They say that when you find your boat you know it, and that’s exactly what it was like</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Delos was named by the previous owner and the history goes a little something like this. And I’m paraphrasing here to keep it really short:</p>
<p>Zeus was a bit of a player and was fooling around with Leto. In fact Zeus got her pregnant. Hera found out and banished Leto. This was a problem because apparently the children of gods can’t be born in the human domain. Zeus called in a favor from his bro Poseidon who used his trident to create a magical island named Delos, which was someplace between heaven and earth. Artemis and Apollo were then safely born on the Island of Delos.</p>
<p>I thought it was a pretty sweet story so kept the name!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How did this epic trip start; did you have any initial plans?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Strangely with a trip to the library on a sunny Seattle Day. I was browsing the shelves and saw a book with a bright blue ocean on the cover. I can’t remember the exact title but it was something like “How to cross an ocean on your own boat.” What?!??! Was that even possible to do these days? I’d been sailing small boats around the lakes of Seattle for a few years but the thought of crossing an ocean blew me away. It then occurred to me that this was the ultimate way to travel! A way to mix adventure and self sufficiency with the art of sailing. And so the dream was born. The initial plan was to sail to New Zealand. I spent the next 4 years dreaming, saving, planning, and selling all my worldly possessions.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>I spent the next 4 years dreaming, saving, planning, and selling all my worldly possessions</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Delos departed Seattle in August of 2009 and we arrived in New Zealand in October of 2010. There was no way I could stop now so another plan was born to sail to Australia via Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon’s. Most of my savings had been spent by this time so we stretched the budget razor thin to make it happen.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_134" style="max-width: 788px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Delos-Hauled-Out-for-Survey-in-Seattle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-134" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Delos-Hauled-Out-for-Survey-in-Seattle.jpg" alt="Delos Hauled Out for Survey in Seattle" width="788" height="1050" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Delos Hauled Out for Survey in Seattle</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We sailed on and off the anchor to save diesel and lived off fish and rice. It was an amazing experience to see just how cheaply you can live on the ocean. We made it happen and arrived in Australia some 7 months after departing New Zealand. The entire crew was really, really broke so we parked Delos for a while and moved to Melbourne, Australia. At this point the crew was myself, Brady, Josje, and Karin. We weren’t done sailing, just flat out of cash so we all worked to put some money in the cruising kitty. Since we’re not retired that’s what we do to follow our dreams- sail, run out of money, work, sail again. Delos was parked for just over a year in Bundaberg, Australia while we scraped together enough for another season.</p>
<p>In May of 2013 we left Bundaberg and began sailing up the east coast of Australia ending up in Darwin.. Our plan was to sail through Indonesia, The Philippines, Malaysia, and into Thailand. We loved the Philippines so much our plan was blown to smithereens and we ended up spending 8 months there! We only just got into Malaysia and plan to continue sailing west. So basically an initial 18 month plan has stretched to 5 years with no end in sight.</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve producing more than two dozen videos of your travels, professionally put together and very entertaining. Where did you learn your skills in videography?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Oh wow, thanks so much! We’re blushing over here! I remember being in Mexico and having a Tequila fueled conversation in Bara de Navidad with a guy I had just met at the bar. He was also traveling and we got to talking about sailing. He insisted that I walk out right then and there and buy a HD camcorder to film stuff non-stop as we crossed the Pacific. I thought at that point maybe it could be a cool project to work on, so I purchased a pretty basic camcorder for about US$200 and started filming.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>I purchased a pretty basic camcorder for about US$ 200 and started filming</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>At first we just goofed around making stuff with still shots, random video clips, and maybe a few subtitles. When we returned to Delos this season in Australia we wanted to step up our game a notch so we bought a Go Pro and little better HD Camcorder. We got a copy of Adobe Premiere and just went to town on the editing process. It’s been quite a learning experience but A LOT of fun.</p>
<figure id="attachment_138" style="max-width: 1050px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Raja-Ampat-Indonesia.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-138" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Raja-Ampat-Indonesia.jpg" alt="Delos in Raja Ampat, Indonesia" width="1050" height="788" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Delos in Raja Ampat, Indonesia</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve had quite a contrasting crew over the last months. Where did they all come from?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">That has to be the most unexpected surprise about this trip. I never could have guessed so many awesome people would sail on Delos. Since the trip began we’ve had 33 people from 9 different countries sail on Delos. Some have stayed for a only a week while others have stayed for a month or longer. Some are friends and family that have come to visit but most we’ve met while out sailing. Brady is my brother and he got onboard in Mexico to help with the Pacific crossing to Tahiti. He was going to stay a few months but ended up staying 5 years!</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Since the trip began we’ve had 33 people from 9 different countries sail on Delos</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Along the way we met Karin (from Sweden) who was backpacking in New Zealand and Josje (from New Zealand) who was sailing on her Uncle’s boat in Fiji. Both were invited to sail for a weekend and never ended up leaving! Most recently we met some amazing people in the Philippines that contacted us through our blog. We spent a few weeks hanging with them and they actually joined us on the passage from The Philippines to Malaysia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">On camera you all seem to get along very well; is this always the case?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I know it may be hard to believe but we all get on incredibly well. Everyone feels more like family than anything else. We’re all out here to have fun and it’s a pretty low-stress environment most of the time. Even on a 53’ boat you can still find your own space. Just jump off for a swim to the nearest beach, or head up to the bow with your headphones in. It’s your own little world! We have a cooking and cleaning schedule and everyone pulls their own weight onboard which really helps.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You left the business world to go on this venture; do you think you’ll ever go back?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">This trip has changed my DNA in a way I didn’t think possible. There’s no way I could ever go back in the same capacity as before. Delos will continue sailing West and when we end up somewhere and potentially settle down I’ll figure it out then. I’ve learned a lot about what’s important in life and I know it’s not doing the 9-5 rat race!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How long have you been in Asia now?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Actually I just realized it’s been a year already. Boy, how time flies when you’re having fun.</p>
<figure id="attachment_141" style="max-width: 1050px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/El-Nido-Palawan-Philippines-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-141" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/El-Nido-Palawan-Philippines-2.jpg" alt="El Nido, Palawan, Philippines" width="1050" height="787" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">El Nido, Palawan, Philippines</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you have a favourite spot so far in this part of the World?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Wow, that’s the toughest question so far. Each and every place has so many special things about it. I’d say it’s a three way competition between Vanuatu, New Zealand, and The Philippines. In Vanuatu we witnessed the true practices of the local tribes, from war dances to exploding volcanoes. In New Zealand we parked Delos in a marina and explored by land. The beautiful mountains, glaciers, and beaches just blew us away. Of course the Kiwi’s are just a fun loving, adventurous group so we got on real well.</p>
<p>In The Philippines we were blown away by the genuine smiles and friendliness of the people. In every town and every village we met someone that took us under their wing and showed us around. We got pulled into village huts for Tagay with Tanduay and Coke, partied with Filipino seafarers for New Years, rode on the tops of Jeepney’s, and met some lifelong friends that brought us into their homes and showed us the crazy big city of Manila. Plus we really like San Miguel Beer. The Philippines were so much fun our 2 month plan turned into an 8 month adventure!</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Where’s next?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Delos is currently in Sabah, Malaysia (Borneo) and slowly creeping our way West. We’ll hit Singapore, mainland Malaysia, and Thailand before crossing the Indian Ocean to South Africa. But, our plans our written in the sand at low tide and have been known to change!</p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">If one of our readers is considering embarking on such an adventure, do you have any advice?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Just get out there and do it! Speaking from experience the hardest part is actually cutting the cord and going. I’ve met a lot of people that have been planning for 10 years or even longer. They’re making everything shiny, making covers for everything, then bags to store their covers in, etc. You and your boat will never be 100% ready but at some point you just have to cast off the lines and head out! You probably already know more than you think so just use good common sense. Oh yea- and bring lot’s of sunscreen!</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>You and your boat will never be 100% ready but at some point you just have to cast off the lines and head out!</h3>

<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Any other words of wisdom about cruising around the World?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">There’s two types of sailors out there- those that have run aground and those that will!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Five million dollars is a hefty grant for any academic to receive, let alone a philosopher. And yet that’s exactly what UC Riverside philosophy professor <a href="http://www.philosophy.ucr.edu/people/faculty/fischer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Martin Fischer</a> received last year for a project that will involve dozens of scientists, philosophers, and theologians from around the world to examine a subject that is probably unknowable: immortality.</h3>
<p>With a subject as ephemeral and amorphous as immortality, one wonders what answers we can reasonably expect for the $5 million price tag. Fischer doesn’t propose to determine whether god exists (he is, himself, a non-believer) or heaven is real. But there’s plenty to work with. Human immortality is a broad subject. It is science and religion. It is futurism and conservatism. It comprises biology, cybernetics, philosophy, theology, cosmology, and quantum physics.</p>
<p>The scope of <a href="http://www.sptimmortalityproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Immortality Project</a> reflects that boundlessness. On June 1, Fischer and a panel of judges will announce their choice of 10 winning proposals offered by physical scientists from around the world, each of whom will receive about $250,000. Judges are still sifting through the roughly 75 proposals they’ve received. But Fischer gave a few indications of what we might expect in a phone interview I conducted with him last week.</p>
<p>One scientist, he said, has proposed to study the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=hydra+immortal&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C33&amp;as_sdtp=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hydra</a>, whose cells replicate indefinitely without deteriorating; several others would examine the neurophysiology of the near-death experience. “There are some interesting proposals looking at how people’s beliefs about the afterlife affect certain things like their ethical behavior, their criminal behavior,” he said.</p>
<p>Other projects might examine “the relationship between afterlife beliefs and economic behavior and longevity,” he added. “There’s a lot of really interesting stuff out there.”</p>
<p>The hard science is just part of the inquiry. In June 2014, judges will disburse a second allotment of $1.5 million among a group of philosophers and theologians to think and write about immortality’s more rarefied aspects. (The remaining million pays for administrative costs like maintaining a website and organizing conferences). Fischer hopes to have the project, which is funded by the John Templeton Foundation, wrapped up for a culminating conference in the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>I chatted with Fischer for over an hour about the project. As expected, the conversation got pretty meta.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">In your writings, you use logic to dispute the idea of god; there’s also a deep, implicit acceptance of the reality of death. How did that lead you to want to study immortality? It seems antithetical to those conclusions.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The context that I’m interested is death and what comes after death—if anything—in all its aspects. The basically secular view is what I’ve adopted in many of my writings, which says that when we die we go out of existence. We don’t have any further experiences. [But if we assume] death is a bad thing for the individual who dies—even if it’s just experiential nothingness—then one might wonder whether immortality might well be a good alternative. That’s how they fit together in my mind.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve said several proposals under review would examine the near-death experience. I actually thought we had closed the door on that. Neurologist Kevin Nelson, in his book, The Spiritual Doorway in the Brain, suggests phenomena like the light at the end of the tunnel and hallucinations are all about reduced blood flow, among other things. In the research you’re planning will you assume the phenomena are physiological or are you leaving the door open to the supernatural?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">There are some people who take it that near-death experiences provide evidence of the falsity of materialism about the mind. They take it that near-death experiences provide a glimpse into an afterlife. They actually take it that these near-death experiences provide good evidence that we have to adopt a completely new paradigm of the mind and consciousness. I’m inclined to the view that there will be adequate neurophysiological explanations of all the phenomena. I don’t think we’re there yet. I don’t think we have them yet, they’re just hypotheses.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>That there was a beginning to the universe doesn’t really affect the issue of immortality. But that there must at some point be an end to the universe—it’s hard to get one’s mind around.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think where we are now is kind of exciting because I think everybody agrees that people are sincere about their reports. They have these experiences and the question is “what do they mean?” or “what do they indicate?” I’m open to the possibility that we won’t be able to fully explain it. But my default assumption is naturalistic and scientific, and I would like to see more and more understanding—a better understanding of the underlying brain processes in these experiences.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Does the news about the Higgs boson—specifically its implication that the known universe may have an expiration date—shape your thoughts about immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>My view is, first of all, it doesn’t bother me at all that there was a beginning to the universe. That doesn’t really affect the issue of immortality. But that there must at some point be an end to the universe—it’s hard to get one’s mind around. It seems like the heat death would take place many billion years from now.I should first say that I’m not an expert on physics and I don’t fully understand the implications of the Higgs boson discovery, although, you know, people do talk about limits on the temporal extension—they talk about the sun flickering out eventually or heat death.</p>
<p>And I’m assuming the constraints of the Higgs boson also would take place billions and billions of years from now. So I’m of the opinion that, instead of strict immortality, we could focus on extreme longevity—billions and billions of years of longevity. And I think the same issues would come up.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Yeah, billions of years is a long time—pretty much inconceivable.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The debate would reinscribe itself. So people would say “yes, that would be great,” they would want it. Others would say “no, it would be inevitably boring or alienating or not a recognizably human life.”</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Is it conceivable that there’s a version of immortality that exists as something outside the limits of the known universe, or do you have to be religious to believe that?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>I guess you wouldn’t have to be religious. You could believe that there are forces or energies or features of the physical universe which we haven’t yet identified or can’t yet fully describe—that there was a kind of [true] immortality that wouldn’t have to be religious. That’s possible. It’s kind of an abstract possibility that we can’t really grasp concretely right now. But I think it’s possible and there’s lots that we don’t know.</p>
<p>If you think about quantum mechanics and string theory and you try wrap your mind around the possibility that there are many, many dimensions to reality, not just three or four, it starts becoming very hard to comprehend. We have certain concepts of present, past, future, causation, physical objects, acceleration, velocity, location. We apply those ordinary concepts to our ordinary lives and they work pretty well, you know? But once you start thinking about quantum mechanics, string theory, the ordinary concepts just don’t apply anymore. And maybe there is a kind of immortality that we have genuinely as part of the physical universe that we can’t yet understand.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Or even beyond the physical universe…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yeah, beyond the physical universe that we know about. There are philosophers who are dualists who think that the mind is not identical to the brain. Or, if they’re property dualists, they think that mental properties are non-physical properties of our brains. And if you think that maybe the universe has non-physical properties, maybe immortality is somehow related to those.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Is there a basic incompatibility between free will and immortality? And I mean true immortality, not putting my brain in a jar for extreme longevity.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Well, I’m going to answer another question first, then I’ll get back to your question. I definitely think that immortality in the sense of living forever and not dying is completely consistent with free will. Now, if you add that determinism is true or that god exists then it might rule out certain kinds of freedom but I think it’s still consistent with other kinds of freedom and it’s consistent with moral responsibility. Now, true immortality, especially as conceptualized in a religious view—I don’t think that’s typically thought of as involving free will.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>There are some people who take it that near-death experiences provide evidence of the falsity of materialism about the mind. I’m inclined to the view that there will be adequate neurophysiological explanations of all the phenomena.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think about the standard Christian picture, in which you’ve been virtuous in life and you go to heaven and you have eternal union with god, that’s typically not a context in which you have freedom of the will. You’re in a blissful union with god forever, but you don’t have the freedom to choose evil. You’re not conceptualized as planning and acting in accordance with your plans.</p>
<p>It’s different in Buddhist views and Hindu views where you have reincarnation—where after you die you still live a life and you can have free will. The Islamic picture is the garden. It’s very sumptuous and lavish with fountains and sensual pleasures. I’m not enough of an Islamic scholar to know if you’re supposed to be acting with free will there or just enjoying great sensual pleasures, but it’s a different kind of picture from heaven. Heaven in the Judeo-Christian tradition is more of an intellectual or thetic realm.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Isn’t the dualistic Christian notion of heaven and hell just an attempt to reconcile the idea of free will here on earth with the idea of immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes. I think that’s correct. But what’s interesting here is, you know, there are these more complicated pictures where on some views you have an opportunity to exercise your free will even after you die.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">It sounds great.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">It’s kind of interesting because, on the Christian picture, free will is such a central part of the importance and meaningfulness of our lives on earth. It’s really what distinguishes us from mere animals. It’s interesting that heaven’s supposed to be an ideal place and yet heaven does not contain that feature that is so important to the meaningfulness of our lives. When we get to the next round of competition, maybe someone will explore that issue.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">I wrote a story recently which showed that neurons—like the hydra —may live indefinitely when unattached to the mortal confines of their host bodies, a discovery that seems to bring that brain-in-a-jar scenario a bit closer. Futurists like Ray Kurzweil believe we will have achieved immortality—or at least super-long term longevity— in about 40 years. What do you think?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’m very interested in this and it’s definitely within the scope of the grant. We have proposals on jellyfish, hydra and related biological creatures. There are also interesting studies of certain worms that reproduce asexually. And so biologists are looking at these creatures with the possibility of making discoveries that could help us cure aging. Kurzweil isn’t really a biologist; he’s a futurist and an entrepreneur. But, yes, he’s a big proponent of supplementation and enhancements of various kinds…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Yes, cybernetics—couldn’t that be part of this picture?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Yes, eventually. Kurzweil and others believe that at some point we will have achieved a biological status where we could still be run over by a truck or hit by a meteorite or die in a fire but we would be medically immortal. We wouldn’t age or die of natural causes. And, once we get to that point, we’ll be able to live long enough that eventually we’ll be able to upload the contents of our minds into computers or cybernetic devices.</p>
<p>I, myself, am skeptical that this will be achieved in the near future. I think 40 years is probably optimistic. I’m also humble enough about these things to know that we’ve been wrong before about the possibility of scientific progress. But I am struck by the fact that you can go in for a simple operation and it can go wrong. So I’m a bit more skeptical.</p>
<p></p>

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Good point. But let’s assume we do achieve biological immortality someday. It seems like any individual action we perform would matter a lot less. Does it in some way absolve us our moral responsibilities toward one another if we all live forever?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">No, it doesn’t at all. I think that if we could all live forever we would still have to treat each other with respect and dignity. It would still be wrong to cause people pain and suffering or violate their right to privacy or religious expression or freedom of speech. I think ethics in basic ways wouldn’t change. If I know I’m medically immortal and I know others—maybe my friends or maybe everyone is like that—it doesn’t make it ok for me to treat them like dirt or to violate their rights or cause them pain.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And when we talk about biological immortality, we often talk about it as though it would be accessible to everyone all at once. But I always think about how much sharper the class divide might be if some humans could afford to become immortal while others couldn’t.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>That’s an excellent point. Since forever, human beings have wanted immortality. It literally goes back to the first epic that’s ever been written, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh lost his friend Enkidu, who died, and Gilgamesh went on a quest for the secret to immortality. We’ve always wanted it. But there’s also been a counter-narrative that it’s overreaching, that it’s asking for too much, it’s not reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>I, myself, am skeptical that biological immortality will be achieved in the near future. I am struck by the fact that you can go in for a simple operation and it can go wrong.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>One part of the reflection on immortality is the realization that it’s not really feasible for everyone to have it. Because if everyone had it there would be overpopulation. If everyone were immortal and their children were immortal there would be no resources left, there would be overcrowding. You can tell stories about colonies on other planets but, short of that, it seems like there would be constraints toward just having an elite or small group of immortal people. And that raises questions about equity and fairness and class.</p>
<p>I look at a genre like the vampire genre as bringing this out because the vampires are achieving immortality at the expense of others. They’re exploiting others to get immortality. It brings up questions about justice and fairness in achieving immortality in a metaphorical way.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">One imagines a kind of scenario where humans who gain immortality begin believing they are somehow more human than the poor schlubs who can’t. I worry that some humans become more expendable than they were before. They’re better cannon fodder for wars. Better for to shine the immortals’ shoes.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Say more about that…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Well, suppose immortality is available only to a certain economic, cultural and social elite—basically the people who can afford it and who have access. We’re not talking about people in the slums of Mumbai and we’re also not talking about people in the project towers here in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Well that’s right. Just as a matter of fact there are people who are seeking immortality through cryogenics in America and it’s very expensive. I don’t know exactly how much, but it tends to be sought by very wealthy people. There are a lot of billionaires from Texas who want cryogenics. People in the inner cities or the slums of Mumbai are not going to be able to afford all that’s required for cryogenics. Also, they’re not going to be able to afford anti-aging medicine, supplementation, all the medicines people take to lower their cholesterol to ideal levels and everything.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing: The rich tend to have lives that they really want to continue. The poor have generally taken refuge in a different kind of idea, and that is the afterlife. With Christianity, that’s been one of the great things about it as an institution. It’s given hope to the downtrodden. If you think of the African-American church in America, it’s a great example of giving hope in the face of poverty and injustice. But the hope is not to live forever and not die. The hope is to have an afterlife in which justice is achieved.</p>
<p></p>
<figure id="attachment_188" style="max-width: 900px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Soldier_Vampire_by_Lostinfog88.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-188" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Soldier_Vampire_by_Lostinfog88.jpg" alt="The vampire: Metaphor for the rich, immortals that will one day enslave us proles.

Image by Freddy R. Ortiz via deviantART</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And the elite become, like a vampire, something of a different—albeit humanoid—species. An immortal human is, at least in a fundamental or philosophical way, a different species, right?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve written about death as being “bad” because it deprives us of things we know we will enjoy. But is it possible that one reason we enjoy things is that we know they won’t last? I think of Dorian Gray’s constant ennui. Proust writes a lot about the dissatisfaction in love that comes right after one possesses the object of his desire. Would we even enjoy immortality after a while?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>Yes. Well…that’s a great question. I think Heidegger is famous also for arguing that our awareness of our own finitude structures our lives, kind of gives it meaning, makes everything precious and urgent. And that, without it, our lives wouldn’t have that meaningfulness. I think that insofar as you really love someone—really, intensely, genuinely love someone—you don’t want to lose that person. You don’t want it to end. And you’ll go to great lengths to maintain the beauty and intimacy of the relationship and not let it dissipate and not let it end.</p>
<p>I think love has in it kind of an internal logic or impetus to continue. It’s so painful when you break up with someone you love or you lose a friend. And it’s so painful because you want it to last forever. There’s this very poignant phenomenon, and it’s very anecdotal, but I’ve definitely heard of various instances of it, and that is when people who have been married for a long time, when one of the members of a couple dies it’s not uncommon for the other one to die shortly thereafter for no apparent physical reason. They die from heartbreak, basically.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The whole idea that somehow love would dissipate if we were immortal, I don’t accept that.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of beauty and dignity to human beings and to great love. My father recently passed away and I watched my mother take care of him for a long time. And there’s just an incredible beauty to that. And the whole idea that somehow love would dissipate if we were immortal, I don’t accept that.</p>
<p>In a finite life, yes, there are challenges already—big challenges in keeping a relationship vital and passionate. Even couples who love each other very much often fall into patterns and habits and take each other for granted. So that would also be a challenge in an immortal life. You’d have to work on it, just like you’d have to work on it in a finite life.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Love isn’t a metaphor here: it’s a specific reason to want to keep living forever.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer"></p>
<p>I think it’s one of the great reasons for living. It’s clearly one of the central ways in which our lives get meaning and more richness and become more rewarding for us. I think if we couldn’t have love and intimate friends in an immortal life, that would really be a problem. But, if we can, you could even imagine the same intimate friends or the same spouse forever.</p>
<p>Think about this: It’s so painful to lose someone you’ve known as a friend or a lover you’ve been together with for 30 or 40 years, imagine how it would be to lose someone if you’ve been together hundreds of years or thousands of years. That would give more incentive to work at your marriages and your friendships in an immortal life.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Caring about life, per se, doesn’t really mean anything. The only life worth living is a life with love in it…</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Yes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Aubrey de Grey has been called many things. “Transhumanist” is one of them, but one he dislikes. “Immortalist” is the tag used to describe him and his colleague Bill Andrews in a documentary shown at South by Southwest this March, though de Grey rolls his eyes when someone drops the word “immortality.”</h3>
<p>The British gerontologist considers himself a “simple medical researcher,” but his research is about fiddling with cells to stop ageing in human beings, and potentially postponing death indefinitely. If it’s not immortality (in de Grey’s world, you could still be dispatched by an infectious disease or a shotgun), it’s quite a close beast.</p>
<p>He believes that tackling the individual illnesses that haunt old people’s lives is a fundamentally flawed strategy; the right course of action is to act at the cellular level to prevent ageing from setting off those illnesses in the first place. His Silicon Valley-based foundation-cum-laboratory, the SENS Research Foundation, is completely devoted to this feat.</p>
<p>In the past, de Grey’s views were often met with skepticism or hostility, when not openly guffawed at. That has not completely changed, but the idea that ageing should actually be regarded as a disease, and that it might even be treated as such, is increasingly gaining ground. Recently, that&#8217;s been given a boost by research into tackling ageing on a genetic level.</p>
<figure id="attachment_118" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400841202712231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-118" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400841202712231.jpg" alt="Aubrey de Grey when I met him in Cambridge.

<p>I wanted to ask de Grey how things are going at the frontline of the anti-ageing battle, so we exchanged some emails (he doesn’t carry phones, “ghastly, horrible things that deprive people of essential solitude”), and we finally met in Cambridge last week.</p>
<p>Drinking a pint of ale and tormenting his greying Old Testament-style beard, he initiated me in the science and doctrine of which he’s the standard-bearer, most of which can be summarized in one question: If we could really wipe old age and death off the planet, why shouldn’t we?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">First of all, let’s look at some recent news. A couple of weeks ago, scientists at Harvard linked the circulatory system of a young mouse to that of an older mouse. The result was that some tissues of the old mouse were rejuvenated. What’s the significance of that?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">It’s very important. This whole idea of linking two animals of different ages—it’s called heterochronic parabiosis—to study ageing has been around for a little while now. At SENS, we work very closely with some of the guys who did that at Harvard. Of course, we’re not going to do the same thing to people.</p>
<p>In general, the experiment has led to a very useful discovery: There’s a particular protein in the bloodstream of young individuals, called GDF11, that helps to reactivate certain aspects of cell division in certain parts of the brain. Now, that’s only a small piece of information; there’s lot more that is not yet known. But I expect that, within the next five years, at least another half a dozen similar rejuvenating factors will be discovered.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So is this mice thing the first step to defeat ageing?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t want to quite say that. All we know is that GDF11 can stimulate certain types of cells to divide when they would not previously divide due to old age. Now, cell division is not the whole story of ageing. In fact, sometimes it can be a bad thing to make cells divide more often, because they may be more exposed to cancer. But still, it’s a whole new tool, and it’s very important.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you think that people may be starting to think that ageing is the real enemy?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I do think so, yes. The things that I’ve been saying for years are finally beginning to get understood. People are understanding that diseases of old age are not really diseases: They are aspects of ageing, side effects of being alive. If you want to cure them, what you’ll have to cure is to be alive in the first place—but you can’t actually do it. So we’ll have to take a preventative maintenance approach. That means that we’ll have to identify the various types of molecular and cellular damage that the body does to itself as a side effect of its normal metabolic operation. Once you’ve identified them, which has already been done, you have to find a way to repair that damage and prevent it from developing into a pathology of old age. That’s what I’m working on.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What are you really trying to achieve? Longevity or immortality?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Well, first of all, any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don’t work on longevity, I work on health. And it just happens that, historically, the main thing that kills people is…not being healthy. So healthier people will likely live longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;Don’t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It’s taken; it’s a religious word.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>How much longer? It depends on how much longer we can keep people healthy. The best we can say at the moment is that the human body is a machine. Therefore, it ought to be the case that we can have the same kind of impact on the human body that we already have now on simple manmade machines, like cars. So, as I said, we can rely on preventative maintenance: repairing any damage before it makes the doors fall off. It seems to work really well with cars; we&#8217;ve got one-hundred-year-old cars around now. So, if you do sufficient maintenance, the sky’s the limit. We should be able to maintain the human body in good health indefinitely, however long we like.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So…it’s immortality, right?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Don’t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It’s taken; it’s a religious word. Immortality means zero risk of death from any cause, but I don’t work on stopping people from being hit by trucks. I work on keeping them healthy.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">By the way, what’s your relationship with religion?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I personally have no religious views, but I have sometimes been attacked by religious people, who said that I was playing God. But it’s quite interesting that it’s really easy to get people coming from a religious background to understand that it would be a sin not to work on this. That’s because ageing causes a lot of suffering, and alleviating suffering is something the scriptures told was our duty. I had some success with that argument.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Ok, what about the social and political consequences of this potentially indefinite extension of life you’re aiming at bringing about?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’ve addressed this issue once or twice, and I noticed that the mistake that people always make is that they think I’m saying we would live much longer in a context where nothing else changes. They think like, “The rest of the world will be just like now but everybody will be biologically 25 forever.” That’s obviously complete nonsense. If we just look at the mathematics, before we’ll have anybody living until the age of 200, a lot of things will have happened, and changed. For example, people always panic about paying pensions to people that live longer. But why would you need a pension if you’re healthy? Even the very concept of work won’t exist in the same way, because we’ll probably have more and more automation. Look, we have at least one hundred years before we’ll have any 200-year-old people.</p>
<p>But we should probably start planning everything in advance. Right now, nobody is going to behave as if it’s going to happen. If you actually managed to do it, one day, society would be completely off-guard.<br />
That’s true, but I am not going to tackle each individual problem—pensions, kids, resources—that might arise in a post-ageing society. I prefer to help people focus on the fact that we’ve a problem today, a really rather bad problem. That is that 100,000 people every fucking day are dying of ageing. That’s the important thing, not worrying about hypothetical problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people are programmed to find reasons why it would be a bad idea to defeat ageing. This is mainly because they fear the unknown, since the world would be very different without ageing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>&#8220;Any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don’t work on longevity, I work on health.&#8221;</h3>
</blockquote>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Aren’t you afraid that living for, say, one thousand years, may be boring?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I find this a very sad question. Of all the ridiculous questions I get about defeating ageing, this is the saddest. Anyone who asks that question must have such a miserable life.</p>
<p>I’m not very happy with my life right now, I must admit.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">How could you possibly imagine that you could run out of things to do?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I have a long list of things to do if I was to live 1,000 years: just think about all the films you haven’t seen, all the books you haven’t read. And by the time you’re through them, you would have at least another thousand years of backlog.</p>
<p>Apart from anything else, the main thing that people enjoy with life is other people, mutual interaction. And we have seven billion people to interact with. But even if there were only seven million people worth talking with, people don’t stay the same; they change over time, so you’ll never actually get bored.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you define yourself as a transhumanist?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t really like to be called “transhumanist,” it sounds like I’m doing something weird. I’m not doing anything different from any other medical researcher, except that the consequences of what I’m doing might be quite big. I think it’s a mistake to label visionary technologists with something that starts with “trans.” It creates a kind of psychological separation that is really counter-productive.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">But would you do some of the things that some transhumanists advocate, like uploading your mind on a computer?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I’m enjoying my body of meat, but if I had no choice I’d certainly be just as happy to continue my existence in another form of hardware, rather than not continuing my life at all. It remains to be seen what’s actually gonna happen. My current suspicion is that uploading, if it’s possible at all, is still a lot harder than the medical approach that my team and I are taking. But I could be wrong, so I’m very happy that there are people exploring alternative methods.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Are you experimenting with any life-extending practice right now?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Sure: I’m doing this interview. I mean, I’m not following any particular diet or practice, because what we have today is quite useless. The most important thing is getting the word out, getting the things to happen sooner, hastening the development of the therapies, rather than trying to use the little we have today.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What are the chances that the two of us are gonna live to a thousand years?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don’t know, but I’m working on it. It’s going to happen, it’s just a question of when. The work I do is simply speeding up the inevitable.</p>
<p>But it is very important to me, because for every day that I bring forward the defeat of ageing, I’m saving 100,000 lives—100,000 lives: thirty World Trade Centers. And I’m very happy about that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>On June 1, a team of six splashed down 63 feet beneath the ocean surface to shack up in Aquarius, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/motherboard-tv-inside-nasa-s-spectacular-undersea-mission-to-save-earth-from-an-asteroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the world’s only underwater lab</a>, located off the coast of Florida. They’ll be down there for 31 days, surfacing only on July 2.</h3>
<p>“<a href="http://mission-31.com/about-mission-31/our-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission 31</a>” will mark the longest stretch spent in the ocean base, and will allow the aquanauts (a title given only to those who stay underwater long enough to get used to the pressure) to conduct prolonged research on the coral reef and its inhabitants, as well as to study the impact underwater living has on themselves.</p>
<p>The expedition is led by Fabien Cousteau, the grandson of the well-known French oceanographer and scuba visionary Jacques Cousteau, and builds largely on his family legacy. Back in the 60s, Jacques Cousteau helped create an underwater habitat called Continental Shelf Station Two, or Conshelf Two, which forms the setting for his documentary <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cIjgL2lkwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Without Sun</a></em>.</p>
<p>Following in his footsteps, Fabien Cousteau is now on the seabed, and you can take a peek at what he’s getting up to yourself via <a href="http://mission-31.com/watch-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream videos</a> on the Mission 31 website. (One had no signal earlier, but I can assure you all was well. I guess living at the bottom of the ocean leads to a few technical glitches here and there.)</p>
<p>I arranged to talk to Fabien by Skype—which apparently works quite successfully so long as the ocean surface isn’t too rough. When we spoke this morning, at 6:30 Florida time, the light was just starting to creep into the submerged dwelling and I could see fish swimming across the porthole behind him. Some of his teammates were already out diving; scientists from Florida International University, which operates Aquarius, were collecting their samples.</p>
<p>I asked Cousteau more about his research, and what it’s like to live underwater.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Let’s start with the why. Why did you want to spend a whole month underwater?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Fabien Cousteau: Well, there’s a couple of reasons. First of all it gives us a full lunar cycle to do science, and that is a very rare if not unique thing, especially here at the world’s only underwater marine research centre. So it gives us 31 days to really gather the amount of data you would gather in a whole year from, say, a boat. It’s very, very efficient to be at the world’s last frontier, in our ocean.</p>
<p>Secondly, it’s symbolic. My grandfather in 1963 had built an underwater village called Conshelf Two where his team lived and worked for 30 days, collecting all sorts of specimens and data outside in the water column. So we’re planning on collecting data—and in fact they’re out there right now—on things like the effects of climate change, pollution issues, as well as predator-prey behaviour, and we’re working with Florida International University as well as Northeastern University and MIT to do so.</p>
<figure id="attachment_169" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401978985659494.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-169" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401978985659494.jpg" alt="Fabien Cousteau.

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So what’s changed since your grandfather’s Conshelf 2 mission?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Certain things have changed and some things have stayed the same. For example, the general concept of living underwater in a habitat is fairly similar, and some of the ways we get our equipment are also fairly similar. As a matter of fact, back in those days they used to use pressure pots they used for cooking to bring things down to the habitat from the surface, just to keep it dry and to keep it away from pressure issues. We’re doing the same exact thing, except our pressure pots of course are much more robust.</p>
<p>We’re also using much more modern technology in the Aquarius habitat—for example, you and I are chatting via wifi from 63 feet beneath the surface of the sea, which back in those days was just not possible! This allows us to do an education outreach program, to talk to students and schools and universities, as well as aquariums and museums, and individuals from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>We can actually share our expedition live, for the first time in a Cousteau expedition, in real time, which is really an invaluable tool that we take for granted up on land. Now that we’re sea-dwellers, this is a very new tool for us.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’ve got some mod cons, then, but what are the main challenges of living underwater?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Well, we only have wifi when the seas are calm and Mother Nature cooperates with us! But we’re used to that: That’s adventure, that’s exploration, and that’s part of the story. The challenges—we’ve been getting along very well. It is a tight space; Aquarius is about the size of a school bus, or 45 feet long by nine feet wide, within which six of us are living for 31 days along with our equipment and our food, and basically everything that we need for that month.</p>
<figure id="attachment_170" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979012228978.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-170" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979012228978.jpg" alt="The aquanauts in Aquarius.

<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What&#8217;s your daily routine?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">Our days lately have been getting up between four and six AM, diving six to ten hours a day, and going to sleep around 11 at night, and of course there are tasks all throughout the day.</p>
<p>We’re using cutting-edge scientific technologies including handheld three-dimensional sonographic sonar systems, which allow a video picture even though it’s through audio, which basically means that we don’t need light to be able to see the coral reef. We’re very excited about that because it’s less invasive and we’re able to study the coral reef in a way that’s never been done before.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What research are you working on right now?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">We’re working on several very pertinent topics for our own species, which are of course the effects of climate change and resulting ocean permutation, and what that does to a coral reef, which is the rainforest of the sea.</p>
<p>We’re looking at certain aspects of pollution and run-off, including of course fertiliser and other chemicals, on coral, to see what that does and how quickly it influences individual corals. We’re also looking at something called predator-prey fear behaviour, which is simply how fish react that are feeding and are hungry to predators. When do they basically take the chance in order to get that meal?</p>
<p>Beyond this, of course, we’re looking at ourselves. I have my sleep watch right here; we’re looking at the sleep cycles that are happening, because we have very limited light down here and of course light affects sleep pattern. Beyond that there’s a lot of anecdotal looks at how an individual lives and is affected by living underwater for such an extended period of time.</p>
<figure id="attachment_171" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979032359575.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-171" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1401979032359575.jpg" alt="Fabien Cousteau arriving at Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans" width="2000" height="1055" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fabien Cousteau arriving at Aquarius. Image: Kip Evans</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">And you mentioned you’re diving for up to ten hours a day—How is it possible to dive for so long without getting sick, at that depth?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">I like your question, because that’s something that’s often overlooked. The most advantageous part of living under the sea is the fact that, if you live in a habitat, you become saturated in this pressure, which allows the luxury of being able to dive for such lengthy periods of time without any additional issues that you would have diving down from the surface. So that allows us to go out into the water all of those hours, whereas if you’re coming down from the surface you have very limited bottom time because of all the decompression obligations.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin, of course, is once we’re done here we have to stay down here for the entirety of the mission and then go through a very lengthy decompression process, 18 and a half hours, in order for us to reach you surface-dwellers.</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">You’re still in your first week now. How’s it going?</p>
<p class="ktt-interview-answer">The first four days have been a learning curve on what to expect, how to feel, what the routine is in such a tight environment with six people, and I think we’re getting to a place now where we’re very efficient with our time, we’re putting on our gear very quickly, we’re getting out into the water very quickly, and we’re getting a lot of scientific data. We’re doing a lot of outreach, and by and large we’re getting a lot of great imagery that we’re sharing live on <a href="http://mission-31.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission-31.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The postcard contained only two words: “Hurry up.”</h1>
<p>John Archibald Wheeler, a 33-year-old physicist, was in Hanford, Wash., working on the nuclear reactor that was feeding plutonium to Los Alamos, when he received the postcard from his younger brother, Joe. It was late summer, 1944. Joe was fighting on the front lines of World War II in Italy. He had a good idea what his older brother was up to. He knew that five years earlier, Wheeler had sat down with Danish scientist Niels Bohr and worked out the physics of nuclear fission, showing that unstable isotopes of elements like uranium or soon-to-be-discovered plutonium would, when bombarded with neutrons, split down the seams, releasing unimaginable stores of atomic energy. Enough to flatten a city. Enough to end a war.</p>
<p>After the postcard’s arrival, Wheeler worked as quickly as he could, and the Manhattan Project completed its construction of the atomic bomb the following summer. Over the Jornada del Muerto Desert in New Mexico, physicists detonated the first nuclear explosion in human history, turning 1,000 feet of desert sand to glass. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the project’s director, watched from the safety of a base camp 10 miles away and silently quoted Hindu scripture from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” In Hanford, Wheeler was thinking something different: I hope I’m not too late. He didn’t know that on a hillside near Florence, lying in a foxhole, Joe was already dead.</p>
<p>When Wheeler learned the news, he was devastated. He blamed himself. “One cannot escape the conclusion that an atomic bomb program started a year earlier and concluded a year sooner would have spared 15 million lives, my brother Joe’s among them,” he wrote in his memoir. “I could—probably—have influenced the decision makers if I had tried.”</p>
<p>Time. As a physicist, Wheeler had always been curious to untangle the nature of that mysterious dimension. But now, in the wake of Joe’s death, it was personal.</p>
<p>Wheeler would spend the rest of his life struggling against time. His journals, which he always kept at hand (and which today are stashed, unpublished, in the archives of the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia), reveal a stunning portrait of an obsessed thinker, ever-aware of his looming mortality, caught in a race against time to answer not a question, but the question: “How come existence?”</p>
<p>“Of all obstacles to a thoroughly penetrating account of existence, none looms up more dismayingly than ‘time,’” Wheeler wrote. “Explain time? Not without explaining existence. Explain existence? Not without explaining time.”</p>
<p>As the years raced on, Wheeler’s journal entries about time grew more frequent and urgent, their lines shakier. In one entry, he quoted the Danish scientist and poet Piet Hein:</p>
<p>“I’d like to know<br />
what this whole show<br />
is all about<br />
before it’s out.”</p>
<p>Before his curtain came down, Wheeler changed our understanding of time more radically than any thinker before him or since—a change driven by the memory of his brother, a revolution fueled by regret.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Wheeler was thinking: I hope I’m not too late. He didn’t know that on a hillside near Florence, lying in a foxhole, Joe was already dead.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1905, six years before Wheeler was born, Einstein formulated his theory of special relativity. He discovered that time does not flow at a steady pace everywhere for everyone; instead, it’s relative to the motion of an observer. The faster you go, the slower time goes. If you could go as fast as light, you’d see time come to a halt and disappear.</p>
<p>But in the years following Einstein’s discovery, the formulation of quantum mechanics led physicists to the opposite conclusion about time. Quantum systems are described by mathematical waves called wavefunctions, which encode the probabilities for finding the system in any given state upon measurement. But the wavefunction isn’t static. It changes. It evolves in time. Time, in other words, is defined outside the quantum system, an external clock that ticks away second after absolute second, in direct defiance of Einstein.</p>
<p>That’s where things stood—the two theories in a stalemate, the nature of time up in the air—when Wheeler first came onto the physics scene in the 1930s. As he settled into an academic career at Princeton University, Wheeler was soft-spoken and impossibly polite, donning neatly pressed suits and ties. But behind his conservative demeanor lay a fearlessly radical mind. Raised by a family of librarians, Wheeler was a voracious reader. As he struggled with thorny problems in general relativity and quantum mechanics, he consulted not only Einstein and Bohr but the novels of Henry James and the poetry of Spanish writer Antonio Machado. He lugged a thesaurus in his suitcase when he travelled.</p>
<p>Wheeler’s first inkling that time wasn’t quite what it seemed came one night in the spring of 1940 at Princeton. He was thinking about positrons. Positrons are the antiparticle alter egos of electrons: same mass, same spin, opposite charge. But why should such alter egos exist at all? When the idea struck, Wheeler called his student Richard Feynman and announced, “They are all the same particle!”</p>
<p>Imagine there’s only one lone electron in the whole universe, Wheeler said, winding its way through space and time, tracing paths so convoluted that this single particle takes on the illusion of countless particles, including positrons. A positron, Wheeler declared, is just an electron moving backwards in time. (A good-natured Feynman, in his acceptance speech for the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, said he stole that idea from Wheeler.)</p>

Corbis Images</figcaption></figure>
<p>After working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s, Wheeler was eager to get back to Princeton and theoretical physics. Yet his return was delayed. In 1950, still haunted by his failure to act quickly enough to save his brother, he joined physicist Edward Teller in Los Alamos to build a weapon even deadlier than the atomic bomb—the hydrogen bomb. On November 1, 1952, Wheeler was on board the S.S. Curtis, about 35 miles from the island of Elugelab in the Pacific. He watched the U.S. detonate an H-bomb with 700 times the energy of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. When the test was over, so was the island of Elugelab.</p>
<p>With his work at Los Alamos complete, Wheeler “fell in love with general relativity and gravitation.” Back at Princeton, just down the street from Einstein’s home, he stood at a chalkboard and gave the first course ever taught on the subject. General relativity described how mass could warp spacetime into strange geometries that we call gravity. Wheeler wanted to know just how strange those geometries could get. As he pushed the theory to its limits, he became fascinated by an object that seemed to turn time on its head. It was called an Einstein-Rosen bridge, and it was a kind of tunnel that carves out a cosmic shortcut, connecting distant points in spacetime so that by entering one end and emerging from the other, one could travel faster than light or backward in time. Wheeler, who loved language, knew that one could breathe life into obscure convolutions of mathematics by giving them names; in 1957, he gave this warped bit of reality a name: wormhole.</p>
<p>As he pushed further through spacetime, he came upon another gravitational anomaly, a place where mass is so densely packed that gravity grows infinitely strong and spacetime infinitely mangled. This, too, he gave a name: black hole. It was a place where “time” lost all meaning, as if it never existed in the first place. “Every black hole brings an end to time,” Wheeler wrote.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>As he pushed further through spacetime, Wheeler came upon another gravitational anomaly. This, too, he gave a name: black hole.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1960s, as the Vietnam War tore the fabric of American culture, Wheeler struggled to mend a rift in physics between general relativity and quantum mechanics—a rift called time. One day in 1965, while waiting out a layover in North Carolina, Wheeler asked his colleague Bryce DeWitt to keep him company for a few hours at the airport. In the terminal, Wheeler and DeWitt wrote down an equation for a wavefunction, which Wheeler called the Einstein-Schrödinger equation, and which everyone else later called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. (DeWitt eventually called it “that damned equation.”)</p>
<p>Instead of a wavefunction describing some system of particles moving around in a lab, Wheeler and DeWitt’s wavefunction described the whole universe. The only problem was where to put the clock. They couldn’t put it outside the universe, because the universe, by definition, has no outside. So while their equation successfully combined the best of both relativity and quantum theory, it also described a universe that couldn’t evolve—a frozen universe, stuck in a single, eternal instant.</p>
<p>Wheeler’s work on wormholes had already shown him that, like electrons and positrons, we too might be capable of bending and breaking time’s arrow. Meanwhile his work on the physics of black holes had led him to suspect that time, deep down, does not exist. Now, at the Raleigh International Airport, that damned equation left Wheeler with a nagging hunch that time couldn’t be a fundamental ingredient of reality. It had to be, as Einstein said, a stubbornly persistent illusion, a result of the fact that we are stuck inside a universe that only has an inside.</p>
<p>Wheeler was convinced the central clue to the puzzle of existence—and in turn of time—was quantum measurement. He saw that the profound strangeness of quantum theory lies in the fact that when an observer makes a measurement, he doesn’t measure something that already exists in the world. Instead, his measurement somehow brings that very thing into existence—a bizarre fact that no one in his right mind would have bought, except that it had been proven again and again with a mind-melting experiment known as the double-slit. It was an experiment that Wheeler could not get out of his head.</p>
<p>In the experiment, single photons are shot from a laser at a screen with two tiny parallel slits, then land on a photographic plate on the other side, where they leave a dot of light. Each photon has a 50/50 chance of passing through either slit, so after many rounds of this, you’d expect to see two big blobs of light on the plate, one showing the pile of photons that passed through slit A and the other showing the pile that passed through slit B. You don’t. Instead you see a series of black and white stripes—an interference pattern. “Watching this actual experiment in progress makes vivid the quantum behavior,” Wheeler wrote. “Simple though it is in concept, it strikingly brings out the mind-bending strangeness of quantum theory.”</p>
<p>As impossible as it sounds, the interference pattern can only mean one thing: each photon went through both slits simultaneously. As the photon heads toward the screen, it is described by a quantum wavefunction. At the screen, the wavefunction splits in two. The two versions of the same photon travel through each slit, and when they emerge on the other side, their wavefunctions recombine—only now they are partially out of phase. Where the waves align, the light is amplified, producing stripes of bright light on the plate. Where they are out of sync, the light cancels itself out, leaving stripes of darkness.</p>
<p>Things get even stranger, however, when you try to catch the photons passing through the slits. Place a detector at each slit and run the experiment again, photon after photon. Dot by dot, a pattern begins to emerge. It’s not the stripes. There are two big blobs on the plate, one opposite each slit. Each photon took only one path at a time. As if it knows it’s being watched.</p>
<p>Photons, of course, don’t know anything. But by choosing which property of a system to measure, we determine the state of the system. If we don’t ask which path the photon takes, it takes both. Our asking creates the path.</p>
<p>Could the same idea be scaled up, Wheeler wondered. Could our asking about the origin of existence, about the Big Bang and 13.8 billion years of cosmic history, could that create the universe? “Quantum principle as tiny tip of giant iceberg, as umbilicus of the world,” Wheeler scrawled in his journal on June 27, 1974. “Past present and future tied more intimately than one realizes.”</p>
<p>In his journal, Wheeler drew a picture of a capital-U for “universe,” with a giant eye perched atop the left-hand peak, staring across the letter’s abyss to the tip of the right-hand side: the origin of time. As you follow the swoop of the U from right to left, time marches forward and the universe grows. Stars form and then die, spewing their carbon ashes into the emptiness of space. In a corner of the sky, some carbon lands on a rocky planet, merges into some primordial goo, grows, evolves until … an eye! The universe has created an observer and now, in an act of quantum measurement, the observer looks back and creates the universe. Wheeler scribbled a caption beneath the drawing: “The universe as a self-excited system.”</p>
<p>The problem with the picture, Wheeler knew, was that it conflicted with our most basic understanding of time. It was one thing for electrons to zip backward through time, or for wormholes to skirt time’s arrow. It was something else entirely to talk about creation and causation. The past flows to the present and then the present turns around and causes the past?</p>
<p>“Have to come through to a resolution of these issues, whatever the cost,” Wheeler wrote in his journal. “Nowhere more than here can I try to live up to my responsibilities to mankind living and dead, to [his wife] Janette and my children and grandchildren; to the child that might have been but was not; to Joe…” He glued into the journal a newspaper clipping from The Daily Telegraph. The headline read: “Days are Getting Shorter.”</p>
<p>In 1979, Wheeler gave a lecture at the University of Maryland in which he proposed a bold new thought experiment, one that would become the most dramatic application of his ideas about time: the delayed choice.</p>
<p>Wheeler had realized that it would be possible to arrange the usual double slit experiment in such a way that the observer can decide whether he wants to see stripes or blobs—that is, he can create a bit of reality—after the photon has already passed through the screen. At the last possible second, he can choose to remove the photographic plate, revealing two small telescopes: one pointed at the left slit, the other at the right. The telescopes can tell which slit the photon has passed through. But if the observer leaves the plate in place, the interference pattern forms. The observer’s delayed choice determines whether the photon has taken one path or two after it has presumably already done one or the other.</p>
<p>For Wheeler, this wasn’t a mere curiosity. This was a clue to the universe’s existence. It was the mechanism he needed to get his U-drawing to work, a bending of the rules of time that might allow the universe—one that was born in a Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago—to be created right now. By us.</p>

<p>To see the point, Wheeler said, just take the delayed choice experiment and scale it up. Imagine light traveling toward Earth from a quasar a billion light years away. A massive galaxy sits between the quasar and the Earth, diverting the light’s path with its gravitational field like a lens. The light bends around the galaxy, skirting either left or right with equal probability and, for the sake of the thought experiment, arrives on Earth a single photon at a time. Again we are faced with a similar choice: We can center a photographic plate at the light’s arrival spot, where an interference pattern will gradually emerge, or we can point our telescope to the left or right of the galaxy to see which path the light took. Our choice determines which of two mutually exclusive histories the photon lived. We determine its route (or routes) start to finish, right now—despite the fact that it began its journey a billion years ago.</p>
<p>Listening intently in the audience was a physicist named Carroll Alley. Alley had known Wheeler in Princeton, where he had studied under the physicist Robert Henry Dicke, whose research group had come up with the idea of putting mirrors on the moon.</p>
<p>Dicke and his team were interested in studying general relativity by looking at subtle gravitational interactions between the moon and the Earth, which would require exquisitely accurate measurements of the distance to the moon as it swept along its orbit. They realized if they could put mirrors on the lunar surface, they could bounce lasers off of them and time how long it took the light to return. Alley became the principle investigator of the NASA project and got three mirrors on the moon; the first one was set down in 1969 by Neil Armstrong.</p>
<p>Now, as Alley listened to Wheeler speak, it dawned on him that he might be able to use the same techniques he had used for measuring laser light bouncing off the moon to realize Wheeler’s vision in the lab. The light signals returning from the mirrors on the moon had been so weak that Alley and his team had developed sophisticated ways to measure single photons, which was exactly what Wheeler’s delayed choice setup required.</p>
<p>In 1984, Alley—along with Oleg Jakubowicz and William Wickes, both of whom had also been in the audience that day—finally got the experiment to run. It worked just as Wheeler had imagined: measurements made in the present can create the past. Time as we once knew it does not exist; past does not come indelibly before future. History, Wheeler discovered—the kind that brews guilt, the kind that lies dormant in foxholes—is never set in stone.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Later that year, he wrote, “How come existence? How come the quantum? Is death the penalty for raising such a question?”</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, some fundamental insight eluded Wheeler. He knew that quantum measurement allowed observers in the present to create the past, the universe hoisting itself into existence by its bootstraps. But how did quantum measurement do it? And if time was not a primordial category, why was it so relentless? Wheeler’s journals became a postcard of their own, written again and again to himself. Hurry up. The puzzle of existence taunted him. “I am not ‘I’ unless I continue to hammer at that nut,” he wrote. “Stop and I become a shrunken old man. Continue and I have a gleam in my eye.”</p>
<p>In 1988, Wheeler’s health was wavering; he had already undergone cardiac surgery two years before. Now, his doctors gave him an expiration date. They told him he could expect to live for another three to five years. Under the threat of his own mortality, Wheeler grew despondent, worried that he would not solve the mystery of existence in time to even the score for what he saw his personal failure to save his brother. Under the heading “Apology,” he wrote in his journal, “It will take years of work to develop these ideas. I—76—don’t have them.”</p>
<p>Luckily, like scientists before them, the doctors had gotten the nature of time all wrong. The gleam in Wheeler’s eye continued to shine, and he hammered away at the mystery of quantum mechanics and the strange loops of time. “Behind the glory of the quantum—shame,” he wrote on June 11, 1999. “Why shame? Because we still don’t understand how come the quantum. Quantum as signal of self-created universe?” Later that year, he wrote, “How come existence? How come the quantum? Is death the penalty for raising such a question—”</p>
<p>Although Wheeler’s journals reveal a driven man on a lonely quest, his influence was widespread. In recent years, Stephen Hawking, along with his collaborator Thomas Hertog of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the KU Leuven in Belgium, has been developing an approach known as top-down cosmology, a direct descendant of Wheeler’s delayed choice. Just as photons from a distant quasar take multiple paths simultaneously when no one’s looking, the universe, Hawking and Hertog argue, has multiple histories. And just as observers can make measurements that determine a photon’s history stretching back billions of years, the history of the universe only becomes reality when an observer makes a measurement. By applying the laws of quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole, Hawking carries the torch that Wheeler lit that day back at the North Carolina airport, and challenges every intuition we have about time in the process. The top-down approach “leads to a profoundly different view of cosmology,” Hawking wrote, “and the relation between cause and effect.” It’s exactly what Wheeler had been driving at when he drew the eye atop his self-creating universe.</p>
<p>In 2003, Wheeler was still chasing the meaning of existence. “I am as far as can be imagined from being able to speak so reasonably about ‘How come existence’!” he wrote in his journal. “Not much time left to find out!”</p>
<p>On April 13, 2008, in Hightstown, N.J., at the age of 96, John Archibald Wheeler finally lost his race against time. That stubbornly persistent illusion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 2007, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has maintained a repository of the world’s agricultural heritage. A series of tunnels bored into the side of a mountain, this vault is climate-controlled, secure against tectonic activity or sea-level rise, and designed to hold up to 4.5 million different seed varieties for centuries to come. Built 900km north of Europe in Svalbard, a barren archipelago in Norway, it sits on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, containing duplicate specimens from other seed vaults scattered throughout the world. There are more than 1,000 crop diversity collections worldwide, but the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard was built away from civilisation because it is the fail-safe, the insurance policy, the last resort.</p>
<p>You take a switchback road up a hill to get to the vault, where it juts from the side of a slope a few hundred feet above sea level, looking like a grim, grey tunnel extending out of rock, snow and lichen. Below the entrance is a tiny ravine, and a small bridge one has to cross to reach the vault. Above the vault, Dyveke Sanne’s art installation runs the length of the roof, then spills over the top down the front, ending just above the door. It consists of a series of irregular blue-silver shards, suggesting fractured and disappearing ice. Below this decorative façade, however, is a less welcoming sight: an industrial, slate-coloured door, chained and padlocked.</p>
<p>Unsure exactly what to do, I milled around outside with a few other visitors. We exhaled visible vapour, while taking in the stillness of Longyearbyen, the main settlement on the island. Even in summer, when tourist season is at its height, it’s far from bustling here. You quickly get used to the frigid silence that surrounds you.</p>
<p>Then came the massive whoosh of air from the seed vault, a sudden and powerful exhaust, venting through the building from somewhere deep inside the mountain. A small but steady burst of water came trickling out the bottom of the vault, draining into the ravine below the bridge. After about 30 seconds, both air and water ceased. We stood around a bit longer, taking photographs, discussing what to do next, until the noise returned — about 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off, regular and steady. My friend Alia turned to me after a few minutes and said, ‘It’s breathing.’</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault has repeatedly evoked a sense of the apocalypse. Everyone from Fox News to Wired magazine has used the unofficial nickname ‘doomsday seed vault’ to refer to the project, and it is routinely described as a last haven and refuge for plant biodiversity should some global catastrophe destroy the world’s crops. ‘The “doomsday” vault is designed to keep millions of seed samples safe from natural and unnatural disasters: global warming, asteroid strikes, plant diseases, nuclear warfare, and even earthquakes,’ National Geographic reported in 2008. Wired, in 2011, referred to it as ‘the world’s insurance policy against botanical holocaust’.</p>
<p>Cary Fowler, the former executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which helped to establish the seed vault, has neither coined nor entirely disavowed, the term ‘doomsday’ as it applies to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault: ‘We believe that in the case of a regional or global catastrophe that this seed vault would prove to be very, very useful,’ he told The Washington Post in 2008. ‘However, it wasn’t primarily with that in mind that we started the planning of this facility.’</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Apocalyptic language works, particularly in an easily distracted culture. It is perhaps the only thing that does work</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>This disclaimer aside, ‘doomsday’ remains the word most people associate with the vault, and this shouldn’t surprise us. For the past few decades, it has become increasingly commonplace to discuss the environment in terms of an omnipresent end of the world. Speaking in 1992, the then-senator Al Gore used the phrase ‘the greatest crisis humanity has ever faced’ to describe the shrinking ozone layer. That same year, Time magazine described ozone depletion as an ‘unprecedented assault on the planet’s life-support system’, one that ‘could have horrendous long-term effects on human health, animal life, the plants that support the food chain and just about every other strand that makes up the delicate web of nature. And it is too late to prevent the damage, which will worsen for years to come. The best the world can hope for is to stabilise ozone loss soon after the turn of the century.’</p>
<p>This was a few years after the spectre of nuclear holocaust began to recede, as though the resolution of one man-made threat cleared the way for a new nightmare scenario. Within a few years, the chemical compounds CFCs were banned from use in refrigeration, solvents and aerosols, and the ozone layer — as a talking point, rallying cry, and apocalyptic scenario — all but disappeared from public conversation. But like doomsday clockwork, a new ‘greatest crisis humanity has ever faced’ arrived, this time in the form of global warming.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" style="max-width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sval-bard-seed-bank.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-110" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sval-bard-seed-bank.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Svalbard Seed Bank.

<p>Contemporary culture seems accustomed to hopping from one apocalypse to the next. This isn’t entirely bad in and of itself; the apocalyptic language surrounding the ozone layer hastened action on the CFC ban, just as Rachel Carson’s doomsday prophecies in Silent Spring (1962) accelerated the banning of the anti-malaria insecticide DDT. Apocalyptic language works, particularly in an easily distracted culture. It is perhaps the only thing that does work. ‘The more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction,’ Carson said in a speech in 1963. But perhaps Carson had it backwards: perhaps it is our attraction to disaster stories and 11th-hour crises that allows us to focus our attention on nature and to marshal energy towards its preservation in the first place.</p>
<p>Along with the language of catastrophe comes a very specific articulation of time. We think of our relationship to the environment in the immediate. Global warming, we’re told, will decimate all life within our lifetimes, or in our children’s lifetimes. In this way, environmental discourse resembles the ranting of religious millenarians, who stubbornly maintain that the apocalypse will happen on their watch. As of 2010, 41 per cent of Americans say that they expect Jesus to return to Earth by 2050. This obsession with impending disaster suggests that we see nature on a particularly human, individual scale. When we think of environmental damage and the human impact on the ecosystem, we think almost exclusively in the short term. The millennium, be it religious or environmental, is always coming the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Standing opposed to this narrow band of apocalyptic time is ‘deep time’, a sense of scale rooted in geology rather than humanity. The concept of deep time originated with the 18th-century Scottish geologist James Hutton, and was popularised by the American writer John McPhee in his book Basin and Range (1981). For McPhee, the chief attraction of deep time is its ability to move us out of short-term thinking: ‘If you free yourself from the conventional reaction to a quantity like a million years, you free yourself a bit from the boundaries of human time,’ he wrote. ‘And then in a way you do not live at all, but in another way you live forever.’</p>
<p>The workings of deep time are evident everywhere in Svalbard. In the days prior to my visit to the seed vault, I was out on the open seas with two dozen other artists and writers, travelling around the edge of Svalbard in a three-masted tall ship. We’d worked our way up the western coast of Spitsbergen, the archipelago’s largest island, dipping into the northern fjords before heading back. Again and again, I was impressed by the sheer stillness of the world around us. Aside from a few failed attempts by whalers, there were no permanent human settlements in Svalbard before the late 19th century, and there is no indigenous population here, save the reindeer and the bears. Even today, this place is remarkably devoid of human activity. We sailed around Svalbard’s edge at the height of the tourist season, and we sometimes went for days without seeing another ship.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A footprint left in the lichen can last for years. Wood used to build 17th-century whaling stations still litters the beaches</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In Raudfjorden, a fjord extending in from the top of Spitsbergen, we rode a zodiac raft out to the Hamiltonbreen glacier. Getting too close to a glacier can be deadly: if it calves, the shard of ice hitting the water can send waves big enough to swamp a small craft. Last year, a piece of ice from a calving iceberg broke off and killed a nearby kayaker. While we were out at sea, another tourist, on a different expedition, was killed when she fell into glacier-cooled water so frigid it triggered an immediate heart attack. As we approached the massive slab of ice, we could see broken-off chunks of it drifting in the water outside the raft. They made a constant crackling noise, like a low, fine static.</p>
<p>Though we were safe from immediate harm, it was less clear whether there was a longer-term menace in all that floating ice. Svalbard contains less than three per cent of the planet’s glaciers, but those glaciers are getting 60-70 mm thinner each year, and annually they add 13 cubic km of icemelt to the ocean, raising it by .035mm per year. None of this is trivial, but neither is it particularly visible or dramatic. When I returned home, a few people asked me if I’d seen evidence of global warming. It was a well-meaning question, but one that made little sense. What would evidence of change look like to a person who’d just arrived in a foreign place? How could I tell what was regular snowmelt, and what was some subtle clue of a catastrophic ecosystem failure? Anyone expecting an on-demand Hollywood apocalypse will be disappointed up here.</p>
<p>‘A glacier is an archivist and historian,’ Gretel Ehrlich wrote in The Future of Ice (2004). ‘It saves everything no matter how small or big, including pollen, dust, heavy metals, bugs, bones, and minerals. It registers every fluctuation of weather… A glacier is time incarnate.’ The time incarnated by a glacier operates on a very different scale, doled out in measurements far too small for humans to witness. The most dramatic videos of climate change — where you can actually see it taking place — are made by time-lapse, a process that converts non-human timescales to those that fit into our narrow perceptual filters. Time-lapse reduces days to seconds, and years to minutes, but the conversion can go the other way as well. When we expand our vision of the natural world from human time to geologic time, our own individual consciousness and the consequences of our action and inaction become thin strata in a geologic archive that contains aeons.</p>
<p>Away from any trace of contemporary civilisation, I had begun to experience time differently. In the land of endless daylight, the sun prowled around the horizon, never rising, never setting. I felt as if I was suspended in a perpetual midafternoon, as though a single day had stretched into two weeks. Time seemed to stop or, at least, to slow to a crawl.</p>
<p>And, in a sense, time does crawl here. In an environment that did not support any human habitation prior to the 20th century, where the permafrost almost entirely arrests decay, a footprint left in the lichen can last for years. Wood used to build 17th-century whaling stations still litters the beaches, and it’s all in surprisingly good condition. These undisturbed remains offer a clue to why the Global Seed Vault is located here on Svalbard. The land itself resists deterioration; even if the building’s climate systems were to fail, nature could help to preserve the seeds. We tend to fixate on the remoteness of the seed vault, a place far away from short-term disasters that might imperil it. But it’s more important to notice its relationship to the landscape around it, a landscape capable of preserving the vault’s contents for hundreds of years, at least as long as the strange wreckage of whaling vessels that sit untouched along the archipelago’s shores. Svalbard resists thoughts that are limited to human time-horizons. Its scale is in millennia, not the current millennium.</p>
<p>The closest thing to direct environmental impact that we witnessed was at Blomstrandhalvøya, across the fjord from the research base Ny-Ålesund. The suffix halvøya means ‘peninsula’, but here it’s a misnomer: the glacier that once tethered Blomstrandhalvøya to Spitsbergen has gradually receded, and in 1991 the peninsula became an island. It won’t be the last; as other glaciers recede, the archipelago itself will calve, as smaller islands ‘break off’ by virtue of the disappearing connective glacier tissue.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>A proper relationship to nature might also do well to be stripped of a histrionic sense of perpetual catastrophe</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Blomstrandhalvøya is also home to the abandoned marble mine of New London, built by Ernest Mansfield in 1911, after he convinced the Northern Expedition Company that there was high-quality marble here. There is indeed marble, but it’s of such brittle and poor quality that it literally fell apart on the ships bound for England. After two years, the NEC fired Mansfield and abandoned the settlement.</p>
<p>A hundred years on, the ruins of New London are remarkably well-preserved. The ore carts are overturned and rusted, but still intact, resting next to heaps of marble piled up along the cliffs, as if the next ship bound for England will be arriving shortly. The piles of marble — deliberate, definitive remnants of human work — refuse to be reintegrated into the landscape. The Arctic allows New London to linger as a ruin, a testament to how difficult it is to make a quick buck in a place as inhospitable as Svalbard.</p>
<p>I carried all these chilly, arctic visions back with me to Longyearbyen after our voyage was over. Standing outside the Global Seed Vault, listening to its mechanical, hulking breathing, I thought back to a walrus I’d seen off the northwest coast of Spitsbergen midway through our voyage. The walrus, curious at our presence on the coast of this desolate beach, at the edge of the uninhabitable polar sea, had cruised slowly past us, not more than 20ft from the shore. There was nothing subtle about him: when his head breached, he’d exhale noisily and laboriously, watching us watch him, before taking a heaving breath and disappearing once again below the surface. From this vantage point, you might almost mistake him for a drowning victim, the way his head seemed to pop up just long enough to take a panicked gulp of air before the water enveloped him again. But this is, of course, only a matter of limited perspective. Under the surface, these hulking beasts are graceful beyond measure, artful and elegant in waters only a few degrees above freezing.</p>
<p>Sometimes what seems like a panicked gasp for breath is something else entirely. The lessons of Svalbard are more complex than the simple, immediate apocalypse intimated by the hype surrounding the seed vault. Cary Fowler, its former director, has hinted that the vault’s real work will be more prosaic than the dominant narrative might lead you to believe. As he told The Washington Post in 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re losing crop diversity everyday in very mundane ways. We have many feed banks in the world but virtually none work on a secure multiyear budget and equipment failures and accidents, mismanagement are commonplace. Occasionally a feed bank will get in the way of someone else’s fight. We’ve lost feed banks in Iraq and Afghanistan not because they were a target but because they were in the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>This recognition of the work of seed banks like the one in Svalbard is quotidian, bordering on the banal, and it can help to refocus an attitude towards the environment that sometimes verges on the self-important. A proper relationship to nature must involve a sense of stewardship, to be sure, and a willingness to work for a better tomorrow. But it might also do well to be stripped of a histrionic sense of perpetual catastrophe. Places such as Svalbard can help us to think on a much longer, deeper scale — one in which we are peripheral characters in a drama taking aeons to unfold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A two mile-thick ice sheet in Antarctica <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/science/earth/collapse-of-parts-of-west-antarctica-ice-sheet-has-begun-scientists-say.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is collapsing</a>, which all but <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/10-feet-of-global-sea-level-rise-now-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guarantees at least 10 feet of global sea level rise</a>.

Developing the necessary engineering solutions, as well as plans to anticipate some inevitable social and economic destabilization, will prove a daunting challenge for millions of communities worldwide. Which is why, along with the engineers, we&#8217;re going to need utopianists.</h4>
<p>In 1962, haunted by the specter of nuclear annihilation, the sociologist Lewis Mumford penned a new preface to his book, <em><a title="The Story of Utopias" href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Utopias-Lewis-Mumford/dp/147743710X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Story of Utopias</a></em>. He noted that utopianism tends to thrive when civilization is in turmoil, and that far from being useless pie-in-the-sky dreaming, our utopian myths, schemes, and fictions hint at what he terms society&#8217;s &#8220;potentialities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[E]very community possesses, in addition to its going institutions, a reservoir of potentialities, partly rooted in the past, still alive though hidden, and partly budding forth from new mutations, which open the way to further development,&#8221; Mumford wrote. In the face of utter destruction by the bomb, he said, there was nonetheless an opportunity to &#8220;renew in man himself the sense of his more-than-human potentialities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re faced with an existential crises of another stripe. Scientists have for the last few years considered a significant amount of global warming, and the sea level rise it brings with it, an inevitability. Now that we have a forebodingly certain baseline in place, it&#8217;s an apt time to look at some of the many utopian ideas that have quite literally—yeah, sorry—been floated to cope with the rising tides.</p>
<p><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maxresdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Floating city" width="1280" height="933" /></a></p>
<h3>Floating Cities</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://utopianist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping a close eye on modern utopianism</a> for the last couple years, and one of the most common themes is, unsurprisingly, <a href="http://utopianist.com/2011/08/utopian-design-giant-ark-to-preserve-humans-protect-nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floating cities</a>.</p>
<p>Whether grandiose, or of the humbler variety, both sci-fi designers and urban planners are imagining how to raise our metropolises up to ride atop the rising tides. First, let&#8217;s look at what is maybe the most prevalent medium for modern utopianism on the internet—design fiction. You&#8217;ve maybe <a href="http://www.evolo.us/competition/noah%E2%80%99s-ark-sustainable-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already seen</a> some examples of the genre running through your feed; the self-sustaining, ark-like city designed to float in a globally-warmed world.</p>
<p>This one, designed by Russian architect <a href="http://www.remistudio.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Remizov</a>, is a &#8220;bioclimatic&#8221; ark—a self-sustaining, floating system designed to harbor insular communities of people in a disaster-ridden, high-tide world. It&#8217;s both apocalyptic and hopeful; we can keep our sleek modernist design and opulent lives, we modern-day Noahs decked out with smart tech, as the world ravages everything unfortunate enough to lie outside the walls we&#8217;ve built.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/103324/the-ark-remistudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch Daily</a>, &#8220;Remizov envisioned this project as the house for the future which can be constructed quickly and withstand environmental disasters through its structural integrity.” Resilient, perfectly-organized floating domiciles aren&#8217;t just the focus of science fiction, though.</p>
<figure id="attachment_93" style="max-width: 2000px" class="wp-caption alignnone site-typeface-body typo-size-xsmall"><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Makoko_approach.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-93" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Makoko_approach-2000x1145.jpg" alt="Makoko Floating School is a prototype floating structure, built for the historic water community of Makoko, located on the lagoon heart of Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos" width="2000" height="1145" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Makoko Floating School is a prototype floating structure, built for the historic water community of Makoko, located on the lagoon heart of Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a poor neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria—now Africa&#8217;s largest economy—local architects are trying to <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-first-truly-floating-city-will-be-made-of-wood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engineer an entire city to float</a>. The first phase has been completed; the school is now essentially a moored boat. But the next phase of <a href="http://www.nleworks.com/case/african-water-cities-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the African Water Cities Project</a> is where the utopian planning begins in earnest.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.designboom.com/architecture/nle-architects-floating-school-in-makoko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design Boom</a>, &#8220;phase two includes the construction of floating housing units that can be interlocked or float independently&#8230; the houses will also contain a state-of-the-art device designed by Japanese company <a href="http://www.airdanshin.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AIR Danshin Systems Inc</a> that detects certain movements (such as earthquake tremors) and activated a compressor that pumps air into a chamber below the structure so that the dwellings may navigate safely over a flood plain.&#8221; It&#8217;s supposed to be completed by the end of this year, but as with most utopian schemes, it <a href="http://www.nleworks.com/case/african-water-cities-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be a bit behind schedule</a>.</p>
<h3>Floating Power</h3>
<p>Nuclear energy was the original utopian energy source: boundless, clean, a triumph of science. To its advocates, it still reflects near-unlimited potential. So, to better suit our drowning world, <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/mit-wants-to-mass-produce-these-floating-nuclear-reactors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT has made them float</a>. These buoyed, modular reactors rise and fall with the seas; tsunamis ostensibly glance off them harmlessly, and they use the vast reservoir of ocean below them as a well for cooling water as they produce a font of clean energy. Problems persist, of course; meltdowns or radioactive discharge are even more a terrifying specter at sea.</p>
<p>Less controversial, but no less optimistic are other floating power sources; Singapore is getting ready to try out a pilot program for <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2014/05/05/short-land-singapore-opts-floating-solar-power-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floating solar panels</a>.</p>
<h3>New Venices</h3>
<p>If we cannot build utopian floating city-capsules, then perhaps we at least will be able to adapt our current infrastructure to the flood. Science fiction might offer some clues as to how.</p>
<p>The sci-fi historian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Science-Palgrave-Histories-Literature/dp/0230546919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adam Roberts</a> argues that &#8220;utopian writing becomes a sort of para-SF, entwining itself round the genre in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&#8221; Yet in traditional science fiction, it&#8217;s rare that irreversible climate change produces hopeful communities; Kim Stanley Robinson&#8217;s 2312 is the exceptional vision that does.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was almost an ice-free planet now, with only Antarctica and Greenland holding on to much, and Greenland going fast. Sea level was therefore eleven meters higher than it had been before the changes,&#8221; Robinson writes. &#8220;This inundation of the coastline was one of the main drivers of the human disaster on Earth.&#8221; Pertinent words, those.</p>
<p>After a couple generations of terrible chaos, some degree of stability reemerged—as well as a New York City replete with Venetian canals laced between permanently submerged skyscrapers. Life, and its messy bustle, goes on: &#8220;A few parts of Manhattan&#8217;s ground still stood above the water, but most of it was drowned, the old streets now canals, the city an elongated Venice, a skyscraper Venice, a super Venice—which was a very beautiful thing to be. Indeed it was an oft-expressed cliche that the city had been improved by the flood.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Floating Free Market Utopias</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s doubtful that libertarians like Peter Thiel are all that interested in fighting climate change; statistically speaking, most don&#8217;t consider it a pressing issue. But their<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/silicon-valleys-next-disruption-floating-autonomous-city-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> long-gestating Seasteading communities</a>, those <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/sea-nations-that-washed-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floating free market utopias</a> where the tech elite can innovate away without the burdensome shackles of government, incidentally appear primed to adapt to a high-tide planet.</p>
<h3>Rising Prospects for Radical Change</h3>
<p><a href="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400010013952485.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-98" src="http://kohette.com/wpthemes/literatum/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1400010013952485.jpg" alt="1400010013952485" width="960" height="627" /></a></p>
<p>From the beginning, Occupy Wall Street was a utopian project in the strictest sense—a leaderless, ultra-egalitarian activist community founded at the foot of its participants&#8217; oppressor. Utopian projects are often most notable for how they illuminate the gulf between imperfect reality and their lofty aims, and the gulf OWS, was attempting to bridge was glaringly self-evident: Students, laborers, and average citizens couldn&#8217;t find work, while profits for the 1 percent soared. A radical adjustment to income equality was therefore in order.</p>
<p>When Hurricane Sandy, pulling from sea levels raised by climate change, washed over New York City, the movement&#8217;s ideals were again translated into action—and we saw a glimmer of how besieged coastal communities might organize to respond to crises. Decentralized, democratic, networked, and better organized than legacy aid efforts, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OccupySandyReliefNyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occupy Sandy</a> empowered communities while delivering disaster relief. It proved Occupy could organize to provide shelter, health, food delivery, and other crucial services.</p>
<p>But, effective as it was, it also made the chasm to utopia again starkly evident, this time in the face of a harsh scientific reality—thousands of people are still without homes, and storms like this are going to keep coming. Occupy Sandy shows how far we need to travel before we&#8217;re ready for the disasters of the future—our institutions aren&#8217;t yet equipped to cope.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we need to consider each of these utopian ideas (okay, maybe not the Steasteads). As Mumford says, even if the total vision they convey are ultimately impossible, they reveal the potentialities in our communities to first adequately imagine, then adapt, life beset by rising seas.</p>
